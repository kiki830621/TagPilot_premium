# Natural SQL Language (NSQL)

This directory contains the complete specification and implementation components of the Natural SQL Language (NSQL). NSQL serves as the standard language for data transformation operations in the precision marketing system.

## Terminology Conventions

When working with NSQL and discussing code implementation, follow these important terminology distinctions:

### File Name vs. Object Name

Always distinguish between these two concepts:

- **File Name**: The name of a file containing code definitions (e.g., `fn_detect_advanced_metrics_availability.R`)
- **Object Name**: The name of the actual code element defined within that file (e.g., `detect_advanced_metrics_availability`)

### Implementation Pattern 

For R functions:
- Function file names MUST use the `fn_` prefix (e.g., `fn_transform_data.R`)
- Function object names defined inside those files MUST NOT use the `fn_` prefix (e.g., `transform_data`)

This distinction ensures clarity in documentation and prevents confusion when discussing code implementation details.

## Overview

The 16_NSQL_Language directory is the authoritative source for NSQL definition, implementation, and usage guidelines. MP24 in the 00_principles directory provides a high-level overview but refers to this directory for complete details.

## 🔄 AI Workflows

### 06_workflows - NSQL Workflows

**WF003: NSQL Query Translation**
- **Purpose**: Translate natural language queries to SQL using NSQL framework
- **Use case**: When users need to convert natural language descriptions to executable SQL
- **Key features**: Pattern recognition, validation, testing

**WF004: NSQL Extension Development** 
- **Purpose**: Develop and integrate new NSQL language extensions
- **Use case**: When adding domain-specific functionality to NSQL
- **Key features**: Syntax definition, function implementation, integration testing

When working with NSQL, refer to these workflow files for step-by-step guidance on common tasks.

## Usage

NSQL can be used either directly through the defined parsers and translators or through the interactive disambiguation process defined in R22.

For translation:
```
nsql_translate("show sales by region", target="sql")
```

For validation:
```
nsql_validate("transform Sales to SummaryReport as sum(revenue) as total_revenue grouped by region")
```

## Directory Organization

The NSQL implementation is organized into:

- **meta_principles/**: Core meta-principles defining NSQL (including MP24)
- **rules/**: Implementation rules (R21, R22, R23, R59, R60, R61, R62, R63) for NSQL
