# Interactive Filtering Principles

## Core Principles

**IMPORTANT:** The app follows these interactive filtering principles to enhance user experience:

1. **Direct Interaction Rule:**
   - Provide filtering capabilities directly within the context where data is displayed
   - Allow users to filter data without navigating away from their current view
   - Ensure filtering controls are intuitively placed near the data they affect

2. **Visual Feedback Rule:**
   - Always provide clear visual feedback when filters are applied
   - Show the current filter state in the UI (e.g., selected filters, active state)
   - Indicate when data is being filtered or processed

3. **Progressive Disclosure Rule:**
   - Start with simple filtering options and progressively reveal more complex options
   - Use accordions, popovers, or expandable sections for advanced filters
   - Maintain a clean interface by hiding rarely-used filtering options until needed

4. **Quick Reset Rule:**
   - Always provide a way to quickly reset filters to their default state
   - Make filter reset actions easily discoverable and accessible
   - Confirm filter reset actions when they might result in significant data changes

5. **Consistent Patterns Rule:**
   - Use consistent filtering patterns across the entire application
   - Maintain consistent positioning, styling, and behavior of filter controls
   - Ensure filter behavior aligns with user expectations

## Implementation Details

### Interactive Filtering Approaches

1. **In-Context Filtering**
   - Filter buttons directly beneath charts or visualizations
   - Click-to-filter actions on value boxes or data points
   - Hover-based highlighting to show filterable elements

2. **Persistent Filter Status**
   - Filter status indicators showing active filters
   - Badge counters showing the number of active filters
   - Summary view of applied filters with one-click removal

3. **Smart Defaults**
   - Context-aware default filter settings
   - Pre-filtered views based on user role or common scenarios
   - Suggested filters based on data patterns or user behavior

4. **Multiple Filter Methods**
   - Direct selection (buttons, checkboxes)
   - Range filters (sliders, date ranges)
   - Search-based filtering (type to filter)
   - Smart filtering (AI-suggested filters)

## Practical Examples

### Direct Interaction Examples

#### Example 1: Chart Filtering
- **Good Practice**: Providing filter buttons directly below a chart that filter the data in that chart
- **Bad Practice**: Requiring users to navigate to a separate settings panel to filter chart data

#### Example 2: Value Box Actions
- **Good Practice**: Making value boxes clickable to filter by that specific metric
- **Bad Practice**: Showing metrics without any way to interact with or filter by them

#### Example 3: Data Table Filtering
- **Good Practice**: Column-specific filters within data tables
- **Bad Practice**: Separate filter form disconnected from the data table

### Visual Feedback Examples

#### Example 1: Filter State Indicators
- **Good Practice**: Changing button appearance to show active state when a filter is applied
- **Bad Practice**: Applying filters without visual indication of which filters are active

#### Example 2: Loading States
- **Good Practice**: Showing a loading indicator when filter operations take time
- **Bad Practice**: UI freezing or showing stale data while filter operations process

#### Example 3: Empty State Handling
- **Good Practice**: Showing helpful messages when filters result in no data
- **Bad Practice**: Showing empty charts or tables without explanation

### Progressive Disclosure Examples

#### Example 1: Basic vs. Advanced Filters
- **Good Practice**: Showing common filters by default, with an "Advanced Filters" expandable section
- **Bad Practice**: Overwhelming users with all possible filter options at once

#### Example 2: Contextual Filter Options
- **Good Practice**: Revealing additional filter options based on previous selections
- **Bad Practice**: Showing filter options that aren't relevant to the current context

#### Example 3: Guided Filtering
- **Good Practice**: Providing step-by-step guidance for complex filtering scenarios
- **Bad Practice**: Expecting users to understand complex filter combinations without guidance

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing interactive filtering:

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize filter operations to minimize lag and maintain responsiveness
   - Consider client-side filtering for small datasets to avoid server roundtrips
   - Use debouncing or throttling for input-based filters to prevent excessive processing

2. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - Ensure all filter controls are keyboard accessible
   - Provide proper ARIA labels and roles for custom filter controls
   - Test filter interactions with screen readers and assistive technologies

3. **Mobile Adaptations**
   - Adapt filter controls for touch interfaces
   - Consider collapsible filter panels for small screens
   - Ensure filter controls are sized appropriately for touch targets

4. **State Management**
   - Preserve filter state between sessions when appropriate
   - Make filter states shareable (e.g., via URLs)
   - Allow users to save and name filter configurations for future use

5. **Testing Considerations**
   - Test filter combinations thoroughly to ensure all combinations work correctly
   - Verify filter performance with large datasets
   - Test filter behavior with edge cases (e.g., no data, maximum values)
