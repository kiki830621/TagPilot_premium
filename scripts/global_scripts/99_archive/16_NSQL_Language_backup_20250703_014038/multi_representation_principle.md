# Multi-Representation Principle

## Core Principle

In Natural SQL Language and computational systems generally, all entities exist simultaneously in multiple representations across different contexts. Clear communication requires explicit identification of which representation is being referenced. Ambiguity between representations is a primary source of misunderstanding and errors in both human communication and system implementation.

## Foundational Framework

The Multi-Representation Principle establishes a comprehensive taxonomy of representations that applies to all computational entities, including functions, data structures, and transformations:

### 1. Conceptual Representations

| Representation Type | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Function Concept** | The abstract idea of what something does | "Calculating average" |
| **Mathematical Definition** | Formal mathematical notation | "∑x/n" |
| **Algorithmic Description** | The logical steps of operation | "Sum all values then divide by count" |
| **Business Meaning** | The domain-specific significance | "Customer spending pattern over time" |

### 2. Code Representations

| Representation Type | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **File Name** | The storage location in the filesystem | `fn_calculate_mean.R` |
| **Function Object Name** | The symbol used in code | `calculate_mean` |
| **Source Definition** | The textual code implementation | `function(x) { sum(x)/length(x) }` |
| **Signature** | Parameters and return types | `(numeric[]) -> numeric` |
| **Internal Documentation** | Comments describing behavior | `# Calculates arithmetic mean` |

### 3. Language-Specific Representations

| Representation Type | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **NSQL Expression** | Natural language query format | `average of sales by region` |
| **SQL Translation** | Generated SQL code | `SELECT AVG(sales) FROM data GROUP BY region` |
| **R Translation** | Translation to R code | `data %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(avg = mean(sales))` |
| **Python Translation** | Translation to Python | `data.groupby('region')['sales'].mean()` |

### 4. Runtime Representations

| Representation Type | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Memory Object** | In-memory data structure | Function object at memory address 0x7f2b4c3d8f00 |
| **Execution Context** | Runtime environment | Global environment in R session |
| **Call Stack Reference** | How it appears in traces | `calculate_mean(data$values)` in call stack |
| **Return Value** | Output produced when called | `23.5` |

### 5. User-Facing Representations

| Representation Type | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| **UI Label** | How it appears in interfaces | "Calculate Average" button |
| **End-User Documentation** | User manual description | "The averaging function computes the mean value" |
| **Error Message Reference** | How it's identified in errors | "Error in calculate_mean: NA values detected" |
| **Log Reference** | How it appears in logs | "calculate_mean executed in 0.03s" |

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Explicit Representation Specification

When discussing computational entities in:
- Documentation
- Code comments
- User interfaces
- Error messages
- Logging

Always explicitly identify which representation you're referring to:

✅ **Good**: "The `calculate_mean` function (defined in `fn_calculate_mean.R`) implements the arithmetic mean formula."
❌ **Bad**: "The mean function calculates averages."

### 2. Consistent Naming Conventions

Follow consistent naming patterns that help distinguish between representations:

- **File Names**: Use prefixes like `fn_` for function files
- **Function Object Names**: Do not use the prefix in the actual code
- **NSQL Expressions**: Use natural language forms
- **UI Elements**: Use user-friendly, accessible language

### 3. Representation Transition Documentation

When showing how an entity transforms across representations, document the full transformation chain:

```
NSQL Expression: "average of sales by region"
↓
SQL Translation: "SELECT region, AVG(sales) FROM sales_data GROUP BY region"
↓
R Function Call: aggregate_mean(sales_data, "sales", "region")
↓
Implementation: fn_aggregate_mean.R:aggregate_mean function
↓
Return Value: data frame with regions and means
```

### 4. Cross-Representation Debugging

When debugging issues that span multiple representations, identify where in the representation chain the problem occurs:

1. **NSQL Expression**: Is the query itself correctly formed?
2. **Translation**: Is it correctly translated to the target language?
3. **Implementation**: Is the implementing function correct?
4. **Execution**: Are there runtime issues in the environment?
5. **Presentation**: Is the result correctly displayed to the user?

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Complete Function Representation

Consider a function that calculates customer lifetime value:

| Representation Level | Example |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Concept** | Customer Lifetime Value calculation |
| **Mathematical Formula** | CLV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) ÷ Churn Rate |
| **NSQL Expression** | `calculate lifetime_value of customers` |
| **File Name** | `fn_calculate_clv.R` |
| **Function Object Name** | `calculate_clv` |
| **Function Signature** | `calculate_clv(customer_data, time_period = "lifetime")` |
| **R Implementation** | `function(data) { revenue <- sum(data$revenue)...}` |
| **SQL Translation** | `SELECT customer_id, SUM(revenue)*0.3/churn_probability AS clv FROM...` |
| **Return Value** | Data frame with customer IDs and CLV values |
| **UI Element** | "Calculate Customer Lifetime Value" button |
| **Documentation** | "The CLV calculation estimates future revenue potential" |
| **Error Message** | "Error in calculate_clv(): insufficient purchase history" |

### Example 2: Data Entity Representation

Consider customer data in the system:

| Representation Level | Example |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Concept** | Customer purchase history |
| **NSQL Reference** | `customer_purchases` |
| **Database Table** | `customer_purchases_table` in DuckDB |
| **File Storage** | `/data/processed/customer_purchases.parquet` |
| **R Data Frame** | `df.customer.purchases` data frame in memory |
| **SQL Query Result** | Result set from `SELECT * FROM customer_purchases_table` |
| **UI Presentation** | Customer purchases table in dashboard |
| **Documentation** | "The customer purchase history dataset contains..." |

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Communication Clarity**: Eliminates ambiguity about which aspect of an entity is being discussed
2. **Improved Debugging**: Pinpoints exactly where in the representation chain issues occur
3. **Better Documentation**: Makes documentation more precise and understandable
4. **Reduced Errors**: Prevents misunderstandings that lead to implementation errors
5. **Clearer User Messages**: Makes error messages and user guidance more precise

## Relation to Other Principles

This principle:
- Implements MP24 (Natural SQL Language) by bringing clarity to NSQL expressions and their translations
- Supports MP01 (Primitive Terms and Definitions) by adding representation dimensions to core terminology
- Extends R19 (Object Naming Convention) by clarifying how naming conventions help distinguish representations

## Conclusion

The Multi-Representation Principle recognizes that in computational systems, entities exist simultaneously in multiple forms across contexts. By explicitly identifying which representation we're referring to, we can prevent confusion, improve communication, and reduce errors throughout the software lifecycle. In NSQL specifically, this principle is critical because the language itself serves as a bridge between natural language expressions and technical implementations, making clear representation distinctions essential to its proper functioning.
