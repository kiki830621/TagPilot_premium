# Natural SQL Language (NSQL) Meta-Principle

## Core Principle

Natural SQL (NSQL) is a meta-language for expressing data transformation operations in a human-readable, unambiguous way that bridges the gap between natural language and technical implementations. NSQL statements can be translated into executable operations in various data manipulation languages (SQL, dplyr, pandas, etc.), while remaining easily comprehensible to users without extensive technical knowledge.

## Conceptual Framework

The Natural SQL Language Meta-Principle establishes NSQL as a high-level, implementation-agnostic language for data manipulation that:

1. **Prioritizes Readability**: Uses natural language constructs to express intent
2. **Maintains Precision**: Ensures statements have unambiguous interpretations
3. **Abstracts Implementation**: Focuses on what to do rather than how to do it
4. **Enables Translation**: Can be systematically translated to executable code
5. **Promotes Consistency**: Creates standardized expressions for common data operations

## Language Specification

### 1. Core Operation Structure

NSQL statements follow two primary structural patterns:

#### Transform-To Pattern

```
transform [SOURCE] to [TARGET] as
  [OPERATIONS]
  [GROUP CLAUSE]
  [FILTER CLAUSE]
  [ORDER CLAUSE]
```

Where:
- **SOURCE**: Input data source (table, dataset, etc.)
- **TARGET**: Output data destination
- **OPERATIONS**: List of transformation operations
- **GROUP CLAUSE**: Optional grouping specification
- **FILTER CLAUSE**: Optional filtering criteria
- **ORDER CLAUSE**: Optional sorting specification

#### Arrow-Operator Pattern

```
[SOURCE] -> [OPERATION] -> [OPERATION] -> ...
```

Where:
- **SOURCE**: Input data source (table, dataset, etc.)
- **OPERATION**: Data transformation operation with implicit parameters

This pattern parallels the pipe operator (`%>%`) in RSQL but uses the more SQL-friendly arrow syntax. Operations receive the previous result as their primary input.

### 2. Basic Operations

#### Aggregation Operations

```
sum([FIELD]) as [ALIAS]
count([FIELD]) as [ALIAS]
count(distinct [FIELD]) as [ALIAS]
average([FIELD]) as [ALIAS]
min([FIELD]) as [ALIAS]
max([FIELD]) as [ALIAS]
```

#### Calculation Operations

```
[EXPRESSION] as [ALIAS]
```

Where `[EXPRESSION]` can include:
- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Functions: `round()`, `abs()`, `log()`, etc.
- Field references: `[FIELD]`

### 3. Clauses

#### Group Clause

```
grouped by [FIELD1], [FIELD2], ...
```

#### Filter Clause

```
where [CONDITION]
```

Where `[CONDITION]` can include:
- Comparison operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Functions: `contains()`, `starts_with()`, `in_range()`, etc.

#### Order Clause

```
ordered by [FIELD1] [DIRECTION], [FIELD2] [DIRECTION], ...
```

Where `[DIRECTION]` is either `asc` or `desc` (default: `asc`)

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Joins

```
transform [SOURCE1] joined with [SOURCE2] on [JOIN_CONDITION] to [TARGET] as
  [OPERATIONS]
  [CLAUSES]
```

#### Window Functions

```
running_sum([FIELD]) over ([PARTITION_CLAUSE] [ORDER_CLAUSE]) as [ALIAS]
```

Supported window functions:
- `running_sum()`, `running_average()`
- `rank()`, `dense_rank()`
- `lag()`, `lead()`

### 5. Extensions

NSQL can be extended with domain-specific functions:

#### Time-Series Operations

```
time_diff([TIME_FIELD], [UNIT]) as [ALIAS]
time_bucket([TIME_FIELD], [INTERVAL]) as [ALIAS]
```

#### Statistical Operations

```
correlation([FIELD1], [FIELD2]) as [ALIAS]
percentile([FIELD], [PERCENT]) as [ALIAS]
```

## Translation Process

NSQL is designed to be translated into executable code in various data manipulation languages:

### 1. Translation Phases

1. **Parsing**: Parse NSQL statement into a structured representation
2. **Validation**: Validate the statement for completeness and correctness
3. **Target Selection**: Select appropriate target implementation (SQL, dplyr, pandas, etc.)
4. **Code Generation**: Generate executable code in the target language
5. **Execution**: Execute the generated code (optional)

### 2. Translation Examples

#### NSQL to SQL

NSQL:
```
transform Sales to MonthlySummary as
  sum(revenue) as monthly_revenue,
  count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
  grouped by year, month
  where region = "North America"
  ordered by year desc, month desc
```

SQL:
```sql
SELECT 
  year, 
  month, 
  SUM(revenue) AS monthly_revenue, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM Sales
WHERE region = 'North America'
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC
```

#### NSQL to dplyr (R)

NSQL:
```
transform Sales to MonthlySummary as
  sum(revenue) as monthly_revenue,
  count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
  grouped by year, month
  where region = "North America"
  ordered by year desc, month desc
```

dplyr:
```r
Sales %>%
  filter(region == "North America") %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(
    monthly_revenue = sum(revenue),
    customer_count = n_distinct(customer_id)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(month))
```

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Aggregation (Transform-To Pattern)

NSQL:
```
transform CustomerTransactions to CustomerSummary as
  sum(purchase_amount) as total_spend,
  count(transaction_id) as transaction_count,
  max(purchase_date) as last_purchase_date
  grouped by customer_id
  ordered by total_spend desc
```

### Example 1a: Basic Aggregation (Arrow-Operator Pattern)

NSQL:
```
CustomerTransactions -> 
  group(customer_id) -> 
  aggregate(
    total_spend = sum(purchase_amount),
    transaction_count = count(transaction_id),
    last_purchase_date = max(purchase_date)
  ) -> 
  sort(total_spend, direction=desc)
```

### Example 2: Comparative Analysis

NSQL:
```
transform ProductSales to CategoryPerformance as
  sum(revenue) as total_revenue,
  sum(revenue) / sum(sum(revenue)) over () as revenue_percent,
  count(distinct order_id) as order_count
  grouped by product_category
  ordered by total_revenue desc
```

### Example 3: Cohort Analysis

NSQL:
```
transform Customers to CohortRetention as
  count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count,
  time_diff(activity_date, first_purchase_date, "month") as months_since_first_purchase
  grouped by time_bucket(first_purchase_date, "month") as cohort_month,
            time_diff(activity_date, first_purchase_date, "month")
  ordered by cohort_month, months_since_first_purchase
```

### Example 4: Complex Filtering (Transform-To Pattern)

NSQL:
```
transform CustomerInteractions to HighValueEngagement as
  customer_id,
  interaction_date,
  interaction_type,
  interaction_value
  where interaction_value > threshold("high")
  and interaction_date is after(now() minus(days(30)))
  and customer_segment in ["premium", "enterprise"]
  ordered by interaction_date desc
```

### Example 4a: Complex Filtering (Arrow-Operator Pattern)

NSQL:
```
CustomerInteractions ->
  filter(
    interaction_value > threshold("high"),
    interaction_date is after(now() minus(days(30))),
    customer_segment in ["premium", "enterprise"]
  ) ->
  select(customer_id, interaction_date, interaction_type, interaction_value) ->
  sort(interaction_date, direction=desc)
```

### Example 5: Comparison with RSQL

This example shows the relationship between NSQL (arrow pattern) and RSQL:

NSQL (Arrow Pattern):
```
Sales ->
  filter(region = "North America") ->
  group(year, month) ->
  aggregate(
    monthly_revenue = sum(revenue),
    customer_count = count(distinct customer_id)
  ) ->
  sort(year, direction=desc, month, direction=desc)
```

Equivalent RSQL:
```r
Sales %>%
  filter(region == "North America") %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarize(
    monthly_revenue = sum(revenue),
    customer_count = n_distinct(customer_id)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(month))
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clarity and Readability

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear names for aliases and operations
2. **Maintain Logical Flow**: Structure statements in a logical sequence
3. **Avoid Excessive Nesting**: Keep expressions simple and readable
4. **Include Optional Clauses**: Use filter and order clauses to make intent clear

### 2. Consistency

1. **Standardize Common Patterns**: Use consistent patterns for similar operations
2. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming styles for aliases
3. **Maintain Formatting**: Use consistent indentation and line breaks
4. **Document Extensions**: Clearly document any custom extensions

### 3. Validation

1. **Verify Translations**: Check that generated code matches intent
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Verify handling of null values, empty sets, etc.
3. **Validate Results**: Confirm that results match expectations
4. **Document Limitations**: Clearly state any limitations of NSQL expressions

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Relation to Documentation Language Preferences (MP23)

NSQL extends MP23 by:
1. **New Language Type**: Adding a specialized language for data transformations
2. **Preferred Usage**: Establishing when NSQL should be the preferred expression
3. **Integration Approach**: Defining how NSQL integrates with other languages

### Relation to Principle Language Versions (MP20)

NSQL implements MP20 by:
1. **Multiple Representations**: Supporting multiple implementation languages
2. **Version Mapping**: Establishing mappings between NSQL and implementations
3. **Consistency**: Ensuring consistency across different implementations

### Relation to Language Standard Adherence Principle (P13)

NSQL supports P13 by:
1. **Standard Definition**: Providing a clear language standard for NSQL
2. **Validation Methods**: Offering ways to validate adherence to the standard
3. **Implementation Guidelines**: Guiding proper implementation of the standard

## Benefits

1. **Accessibility**: Makes data transformation operations accessible to non-technical users
2. **Clarity**: Expresses data operations in a clear, unambiguous way
3. **Implementation Flexibility**: Allows translation to multiple implementation languages
4. **Consistency**: Creates consistent expression of data operations
5. **Documentation Value**: Serves as self-documenting specification for data transformations
6. **Reusability**: Facilitates reuse of transformation patterns across implementations
7. **Maintainability**: Separates intent from implementation details

## Conclusion

The Natural SQL Language (NSQL) Meta-Principle establishes a human-readable, precise meta-language for expressing data transformation operations. By focusing on what data manipulations should be performed rather than how they should be implemented, NSQL enables clearer communication, better documentation, and more flexible implementation of data operations across the precision marketing system.

NSQL bridges the gap between natural language and technical implementation, making data transformation concepts accessible to a wider audience while maintaining the precision needed for unambiguous execution. This approach supports both human understanding and technical implementation, improving communication between stakeholders with different technical backgrounds.
