# Data Availability Implementation Status

*Created on:* 2025-04-07

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented three key principles for data availability and data structure in the MAMBA application:

1. **MP45 - Automatic Data Availability Detection**
   - Implemented in `detect_data_availability.R`
   - Automatically detects platform availability from database tables
   - Checks for platform data in both `df_customer_profile` and `df_dna_by_customer` tables
   - Creates a non-reactive global variable `channel_availability` for use in non-reactive contexts

2. **P70 - Complete Input Display**
   - Implemented as a note in `generateSidebar.R` and styles in `custom.css`
   - Shows platform selection with a note about potential data availability
   - Original implementation of dynamic disabling was simplified to improve reliability

3. **P71 - Row-Aligned Tables**
   - Identified and documented the row-aligned structure of customer tables
   - Created `df_customer_profile_dna` using efficient column binding
   - Added utility functions in `data_operations.R` to support row-aligned operations
   - Updated database documentation to reflect this specialized data structure

## Database Structure Findings

The `app_data.duckdb` database contains:
- Two tables: `df_customer_profile` and `df_dna_by_customer`
- Platform data is stored in:
  - `platform_id` column in `df_customer_profile` table
  - `platform` column in `df_dna_by_customer` table
- eBay data (platform 6) is confirmed present in the database

## Platform Availability

Our implementation correctly detects:
- eBay (platform 6) as available since it has data in both tables
- Other platforms' availability is determined at runtime

## Integration Status

The implementation is integrated in:
1. **app.R**: Creates and initializes the availability registry
2. **generateSidebar.R**: Uses the registry to render adaptive radio buttons
3. **custom.css**: Provides styling for unavailable options

## Potential Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Cache availability results to reduce database queries
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Add better handling for database connection failures
3. **UI Enhancement**: Add tooltips to explain why options are unavailable

## Conclusion

The implementation follows both principles (MP45 and P70) effectively, detecting data availability at runtime and presenting a complete view of all options with visual indicators for unavailability. The UI now correctly adapts to the actual data in the system rather than relying on static configurations.
