# Language Preferences Meta-Principle

## Core Principle

Different types of content in the precision marketing system should be expressed in their preferred formal languages to maximize clarity, precision, and utility. This meta-principle establishes which formal language should be the primary expression method for each type of content, while allowing supplementary expressions in other languages when beneficial.

## Conceptual Framework

The Language Preferences Meta-Principle recognizes that different concepts and structures are best expressed in different formal languages. By establishing preferred languages for each type of content, this principle ensures that all communication leverages the strengths of each formalism while maintaining consistency across the system.

This principle creates a mapping between:
1. **Types of Content**: What is being expressed (definitions, algorithms, data operations, etc.)
2. **Preferred Languages**: Which formal language best expresses that content
3. **Supplementary Languages**: Which additional languages provide valuable perspectives

## Primary Language Mappings

The following mappings establish the preferred primary language for different types of documentation:

### 1. Terminological Definitions

**Primary Language**: Logical Formulation (MP0021)

**Rationale**: Terminology requires precise definition of concepts and their relationships, which formal logic expresses with minimal ambiguity.

**Example**:
```
∀p ∈ Parameter, has_attribute(p, "source", "YAML")
∀d ∈ DefaultValue, has_attribute(d, "source", "Component")
∀x, ¬(x ∈ Parameter ∧ x ∈ DefaultValue)
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Visual Representation

### 2. Algorithms and Procedures

**Primary Language**: Pseudocode (MP0022)

**Rationale**: Algorithms and procedures describe step-by-step processes, which pseudocode expresses clearly with its procedural syntax and control structures.

**Example**:
```
ALGORITHM FindOptimalParameter(data, objective_function, constraints)
    LET best_value = NULL
    LET best_score = NEGATIVE_INFINITY
    
    FOR EACH candidate IN GenerateCandidates(constraints)
        LET score = EvaluateObjective(candidate, data, objective_function)
        
        IF score > best_score THEN
            SET best_score = score
            SET best_value = candidate
        END IF
    END FOR EACH
    
    RETURN best_value
END ALGORITHM
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Mathematical Notation, Code Implementation

### 3. System Architecture

**Primary Language**: Visual Representation

**Rationale**: Architecture involves structural relationships between components, which visual representations communicate most effectively through spatial layout and connection patterns.

**Example**:
```
[Component A] ---- uses ----> [Component B]
     |                             |
     |                             |
  creates                       consumes
     |                             |
     v                             v
[Component C] <--- sends data -- [Component D]
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Pseudocode

### 4. Mathematical Models

**Primary Language**: Mathematical Notation

**Rationale**: Mathematical models involve equations, functions, and formal relationships, which mathematical notation expresses concisely and precisely.

**Example**:
```
CLV = Σ (Rt / (1 + i)^t) - AC
where:
  CLV = Customer Lifetime Value
  Rt = Revenue at time t
  i = Discount rate
  AC = Acquisition Cost
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Code Implementation

### 5. User Interfaces and Interactions

**Primary Language**: Visual Representation

**Rationale**: User interfaces are inherently visual and interactive, making visual representations the most direct expression of their structure and behavior.

**Example**:
```
[Header]
  |
[Navigation Bar]
  |
[Main Content] --- [Sidebar]
  |                  |
[Footer]           [Filters]
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Pseudocode

### 6. Component Interfaces

**Primary Language**: Code Implementation

**Rationale**: Component interfaces define how code interacts with components, making concrete code examples the clearest expression of their usage.

**Example**:
```r
# Component interface example
customerProfile <- function(id, data_source, options = list()) {
  # Implementation
}
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Pseudocode

### 7. Business Rules

**Primary Language**: Logical Formulation (MP0021)

**Rationale**: Business rules define constraints and conditions, which logical formulations express precisely with clear evaluation semantics.

**Example**:
```
∀customer ∈ PremiumSegment, 
  access_level(customer, "premium_content") = TRUE
  
∀order ∈ Orders, total(order) > 100 →
  eligible_for_discount(order, "volume_discount")
```

**Supplementary**: Natural Language, Pseudocode

### 8. Data Schemas

**Primary Language**: Code Implementation

**Rationale**: Data schemas define structure and types, which code implementations express clearly with their type systems and constraints.

**Example**:
```r
CustomerSchema <- list(
  id = list(type = "string", required = TRUE),
  name = list(type = "string", required = TRUE),
  email = list(type = "string", format = "email"),
  segment = list(type = "string", enum = c("new", "regular", "premium")),
  created_at = list(type = "datetime")
)
```

**Supplementary**: Visual Representation, Logical Formulation

### 9. Data Transformation Operations

**Primary Language**: Natural SQL (NSQL) (MP0024)

**Rationale**: Data transformation operations involve manipulating datasets, which NSQL expresses in a readable, intuitive way that bridges the gap between natural language and technical SQL or dplyr operations.

**Example**:
```
transform Sales to MonthlySummary as 
  sum(revenue) as monthly_revenue, 
  count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
  grouped by year, month
  where region = "North America"
  ordered by year desc, month desc
```

**Alternative Example**:
```
show monthly revenue and customer count by year and month for North America
```

**Supplementary**: Code Implementation (SQL/dplyr), Pseudocode

**Usage Requirement**: All data manipulation prompts and instructions should be expressed in NSQL to ensure clarity, consistency, and translatability. Users and systems should prioritize NSQL over general natural language or specific implementation languages when discussing data manipulations.

## Supplementary Language Usage

While each type of content has a preferred primary language, supplementary languages provide additional perspectives and should be used when they add value:

### 1. When to Add Supplementary Languages

Use supplementary languages when:

1. **Complex Concepts**: The concept is complex and benefits from multiple perspectives
2. **Audience Diversity**: The documentation targets diverse audiences with different backgrounds
3. **Critical Components**: The component is critical and deserves comprehensive documentation
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Additional implementation guidance would be valuable
5. **Potential Ambiguity**: The primary language might leave room for misinterpretation

### 2. Priority of Supplementary Languages

When using supplementary languages, consider this priority order:

1. **Natural Language**: Always include natural language explanation for accessibility
2. **Primary Language of Related Content**: Use the primary language of closely related content
3. **Language Serving Specific Need**: Add languages that serve specific documentation needs

### 3. Integration of Multiple Languages

When using multiple languages, integrate them effectively:

1. **Cross-References**: Include cross-references between different language versions
2. **Consistency**: Ensure consistency between different language versions
3. **Complementary Focus**: Emphasize different aspects in different languages
4. **Progressive Detail**: Use different languages for different levels of detail

## System Documentation and Communication

### 1. Meta-Principles (MP)

**Primary Language**: Natural Language

**Rationale**: Meta-principles establish foundational concepts that must be accessible to all stakeholders, making natural language the most appropriate primary expression.

**Supplementary**: Logical Formulation

**Required Sections**:
1. Natural Language explanation
2. Logical formulation for key relationships

### 2. Principles (P)

**Primary Language**: Natural Language

**Rationale**: Principles provide general guidance that must be broadly understood, making natural language the most accessible expression.

**Supplementary**: Logical Formulation, Visual Representation

**Required Sections**:
1. Natural Language explanation
2. Visual representation of key relationships (where applicable)

### 3. Rules (R)

**Primary Language**: Natural Language with Pseudocode

**Rationale**: Rules provide specific implementation guidance, making a combination of natural language and pseudocode most effective for clear direction.

**Supplementary**: Logical Formulation, Code Implementation

**Required Sections**:
1. Natural Language explanation
2. Pseudocode for procedural aspects
3. Example code implementation (where applicable)

### 4. Prompts and Instructions

**Primary Language**: Context-Dependent (following content type mappings)

**Rationale**: Prompts and instructions should use the same formal languages as the content they reference to maintain consistency and clarity.

**Specific Requirements**:
1. **Data Operations**: NSQL (as specified in Section 9)
2. **Algorithmic Operations**: Pseudocode (following MP0022)
3. **Business Rules**: Logical Formulation (following MP0021)
4. **System Interactions**: Natural Language with Domain-Specific Terms

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Content Organization

When expressing content with multiple languages:

1. **Consistent Structure**: Use consistent structure across all versions
2. **Language Sections**: Organize content by language within documents
3. **Primary First**: Present the primary language version first
4. **Clear Delineation**: Clearly separate different language versions

### 2. Language Selection Process

Follow this process when selecting languages for any content:

1. **Identify Content Type**: Determine what type of content is being expressed
2. **Apply Primary Mapping**: Use the primary language specified for that content type
3. **Assess Need for Supplements**: Evaluate whether supplementary languages would add value
4. **Select Supplements**: Choose appropriate supplementary languages based on guidelines
5. **Document Choices**: Document language selection rationale when non-standard

### 3. File and Communication Organization

Organize content with multiple language versions:

1. **Primary Format**: Use the primary language as the main format
2. **Supplementary Formats**: Include supplementary languages as needed
3. **Cross-References**: Include cross-references between different versions
4. **Organization Structure**: Organize by content purpose rather than by language

### 4. Interactive Systems and Prompts

For interactive systems and user prompts:

1. **Context Awareness**: Use language appropriate to the context
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent language within a conversation or interaction
3. **Validation**: Validate that expressions follow the appropriate language standards
4. **Disambiguation**: Provide disambiguation when language usage is unclear

## Examples

### Example 1: Component Documentation with Multiple Languages

**Component**: HybridSidebar

**Primary (Pseudocode)**:
```
# hybrid_sidebar_pseudo.md

COMPONENT HybridSidebar(id, active_module, data_source)
    # Global section
    RENDER GlobalControlsSection(id, data_source)
    
    # Module-specific section
    IF active_module == "micro" THEN
        RENDER MicroControlsSection(id, data_source)
    ELSE IF active_module == "macro" THEN
        RENDER MacroControlsSection(id, data_source)
    ELSE IF active_module == "target" THEN
        RENDER TargetControlsSection(id, data_source)
    END IF
END COMPONENT
```

**Supplementary (Visual)**:
```
# hybrid_sidebar_visual.md

[HybridSidebar]
    |
    |---- [Global Controls Section]
    |        |
    |        |---- [Distribution Channel]
    |        |---- [Product Category]
    |        |---- [Geographic Region]
    |
    |---- [Module-Specific Section]
             |
             |---- IF micro: [Micro Controls]
             |---- IF macro: [Macro Controls]
             |---- IF target: [Target Controls]
```

**Supplementary (Code)**:
```r
# hybrid_sidebar_code_r.md

sidebarHybridUI <- function(id, active_module = "main") {
  ns <- NS(id)
  
  sidebar(
    # Global controls section
    radioButtons(
      inputId = ns("distribution_channel"),
      label = "行銷通路",
      choices = list(
        "Amazon" = "amazon",
        "Official Website" = "officialwebsite"
      )
    ),
    
    # Module-specific section
    conditionalPanel(
      condition = sprintf("input['%s'] == 'micro'", ns("active_module")),
      # Micro controls
      textInput(ns("customer_search"), "顧客搜尋")
    ),
    conditionalPanel(
      condition = sprintf("input['%s'] == 'macro'", ns("active_module")),
      # Macro controls
      selectInput(ns("aggregation_level"), "資料彙總層級", choices = list())
    )
  )
}
```

### Example 2: Business Rule Documentation with Multiple Languages

**Business Rule**: Premium Customer Access

**Primary (Logical)**:
```
# premium_access_logic.md

∀customer ∈ Customers, 
  (lifetime_value(customer) > PREMIUM_THRESHOLD) → 
  (access_level(customer) = "premium")

∀customer ∈ Customers,
  (access_level(customer) = "premium") →
  (can_access(customer, "premium_reports") ∧
   can_access(customer, "priority_support") ∧
   can_access(customer, "exclusive_offers"))
```

**Supplementary (Natural Language)**:
```
# premium_access.md

Customers whose lifetime value exceeds the premium threshold are classified as premium customers. Premium customers have access to premium reports, priority support, and exclusive offers.
```

**Supplementary (Pseudocode)**:
```
# premium_access_pseudo.md

FUNCTION DetermineAccessLevel(customer)
    IF customer.lifetime_value > PREMIUM_THRESHOLD THEN
        RETURN "premium"
    ELSE IF customer.purchase_count > REGULAR_THRESHOLD THEN
        RETURN "regular"
    ELSE
        RETURN "basic"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CanAccess(customer, resource)
    LET access_level = DetermineAccessLevel(customer)
    
    IF resource == "premium_reports" THEN
        RETURN access_level == "premium"
    ELSE IF resource == "priority_support" THEN
        RETURN access_level == "premium"
    ELSE IF resource == "exclusive_offers" THEN
        RETURN access_level == "premium"
    ELSE
        RETURN TRUE  # Basic resources available to all
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Relation to Principle Language Versions (MP0020)

This principle extends MP0020 by:
1. **Language Mapping**: Establishing which language is preferred for which content
2. **Usage Guidance**: Providing specific guidance on when to use each language
3. **Integration Approaches**: Explaining how to integrate multiple language versions

### Relation to Formal Logic Language (MP0021)

This principle directs the use of MP0021 by:
1. **Appropriate Application**: Specifying where formal logic is most appropriate
2. **Integration**: Explaining how to integrate logical formulations with other languages
3. **Supplementary Use**: Guiding the use of logical formulation as a supplement

### Relation to Pseudocode Conventions (MP0022)

This principle directs the use of MP0022 by:
1. **Algorithmic Focus**: Emphasizing pseudocode for algorithmic content
2. **Primary Usage**: Establishing pseudocode as the primary language for procedures
3. **Extension**: Showing how pseudocode relates to other expression forms

### Relation to Natural SQL Language (MP0024)

This principle directs the use of MP0024 by:
1. **Data Transformation Focus**: Emphasizing NSQL for data manipulation operations
2. **Primary Usage**: Establishing NSQL as the primary language for data transformation
3. **Implementation Bridge**: Positioning NSQL as a bridge between intent and implementation
4. **Integration**: Explaining how NSQL complements other formal languages

## Benefits

1. **Optimal Expression**: Uses the most appropriate language for each type of content
2. **Consistent Communication**: Creates consistency in how different content is expressed
3. **Clear Expectations**: Sets clear expectations for language standards
4. **Improved Comprehension**: Enhances understanding through appropriate formalisms
5. **Efficient Communication**: Reduces unnecessary translation between languages
6. **Quality Assurance**: Improves overall quality and utility of all expressions
7. **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitates knowledge transfer across diverse teams

## Conclusion

The Language Preferences Meta-Principle establishes which formal languages should be used as the primary expression method for different types of content. By mapping content types to their optimal expression languages, this principle ensures that all communication leverages the strengths of each formalism while maintaining consistency across the system.

This approach enhances clarity, precision, and utility in all forms of communication—from documentation to interactive prompts to system interactions—while providing flexibility to add supplementary perspectives when valuable. By following these preferences, the system achieves more effective communication, better knowledge transfer, and higher-quality expression overall.
