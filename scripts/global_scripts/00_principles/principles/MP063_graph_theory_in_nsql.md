# Graph Theory in NSQL

## Core Principle

Graph theory concepts provide a rigorous foundation for file system, data relationship, and process flow representations within the Natural SQL Language (NSQL). By integrating graph theory terminology, NSQL gains precision in describing structural relationships, pathways, and transformations in both data and system architecture contexts.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Vertex-Path Distinction

The fundamental distinction between vertices (points/locations) and paths (routes/connections) applies across the system:

| Graph Theory Term | Application in NSQL | Example |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Vertex** | A specific location or entity | `ROOT_DIR`, `DATA_NODE` |
| **Path** | Connection or route between vertices | `PATH`, `DATA_FLOW` |

```
# NSQL Example
ROOT_DIR.connect(PATH, APP_DIR)
```

### 2. Graph Structure Terminology

NSQL incorporates these core graph theory terms:

| Term | Definition | NSQL Application |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Graph** | Collection of vertices and edges | Data structure, system architecture |
| **Edge** | Connection between vertices | Relationship, data flow |
| **Directed Edge** | Edge with direction | Process flow, dependency |
| **Weight** | Value assigned to edge | Cost, priority, distance |
| **Subgraph** | Subset of vertices and edges | Module, component, subsystem |

### 3. Graph Operations

NSQL supports these graph operations:

```
# Traversal
path = source.traverse_to(destination)

# Path finding
shortest_path = graph.find_shortest_path(start, end, weight="processing_time")

# Connectivity analysis
connected_components = graph.get_connected_components()
```

### 4. File System Representation

File system operations use graph terminology:

```
# File system as graph
fs_graph = filesystem.as_graph()

# Directory (vertex) and path (edge) operations
ROOT_DIR.get_neighbors()
PATH.get_weight()
```

### 5. Data Relationship Modeling

Entity relationships expressed as graph structures:

```
# Entity graph creation
customer_product_graph = create_graph(customers, products, purchases)

# Relationship analysis
influential_nodes = customer_product_graph.find_central_vertices()
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Naming Conventions

Variables representing graph concepts should follow these conventions:

- Vertex/node variables: Use nouns ending with `_DIR`, `_NODE`, or `_VERTEX`
  - Example: `ROOT_DIR`, `DATA_NODE`, `CONFIG_VERTEX`

- Edge/path variables: Use nouns containing `_PATH`, `_EDGE`, or `_FLOW`
  - Example: `CONFIG_PATH`, `DATA_FLOW`, `DEPENDENCY_EDGE`

### 2. Function Naming

Functions operating on graph structures should use graph theory terminology:

- Traversal: `traverse()`, `find_path()`, `shortest_path()`
- Analysis: `centrality()`, `connected_components()`, `is_cyclic()`
- Modification: `add_vertex()`, `remove_edge()`, `merge_subgraphs()`

### 3. Graph Structure Declaration

Standard pattern for declaring graph structures:

```
# Create graph
graph_name = create_graph(vertex_set, edge_set, directed=TRUE)

# Define subgraph
subgraph_name = graph_name.subgraph(vertex_subset)
```

## Integration with Existing NSQL

This meta-principle extends NSQL with graph theory terminology while maintaining compatibility with existing patterns:

1. **Arrow Operator Enhancement**:
   ```
   # Standard NSQL arrow
   [SOURCE] -> [OPERATION] -> [TARGET]
   
   # Enhanced with graph terminology
   [VERTEX_A] -[EDGE_TYPE]-> [VERTEX_B]
   ```

2. **Transform Pattern Enhancement**:
   ```
   # Standard transform pattern
   transform [SOURCE] to [TARGET] as
     [OPERATIONS]
   
   # Graph theory enhanced
   traverse from [SOURCE_VERTEX] to [TARGET_VERTEX] via
     [PATH_OPERATIONS]
   ```

## Practical Applications

### 1. Directory Structure Navigation

```
# Find all paths from ROOT_DIR to configuration files
paths = ROOT_DIR.find_all_paths(file_type="config")

# Get shortest path to specific file
shortest = ROOT_DIR.shortest_path(target="settings.yaml")
```

### 2. Data Transformation Flow

```
# Create data flow graph
etl_graph = create_flow_graph(data_sources, transformations, outputs)

# Analyze and optimize
bottlenecks = etl_graph.find_critical_path()
optimized = etl_graph.optimize(metric="processing_time")
```

### 3. Dependency Management

```
# Module dependency graph
dep_graph = create_dependency_graph(modules)

# Check for circular dependencies
if dep_graph.is_cyclic():
    dependency_cycles = dep_graph.find_cycles()
```

## Relationship to Other Meta-Principles

This meta-principle:

1. **Extends MP0024 (Natural SQL Language)** by adding graph theory terminology
2. **Implements MP0001 (Primitive Terms and Definitions)** by formally defining structural terms
3. **Relates to P13 (Language Standard Adherence)** by establishing standards for graph concepts
