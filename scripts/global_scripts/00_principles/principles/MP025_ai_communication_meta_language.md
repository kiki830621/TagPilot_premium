# AIMETA: AI Communication Meta-Language

## Core Principle

AIMETA (AI Meta-language) establishes conventions for human-AI interactions in the precision marketing system, focusing on clear indication of language types, processing instructions, and contextual directives. This meta-language provides standardized patterns for communicating meta-information about the content being exchanged and desired processing approach.

## Conceptual Framework

The AI Communication Meta-Language recognizes that effective human-AI communication requires not just content, but also contextual indicators about how that content should be interpreted and processed. By establishing standard patterns for these meta-communications, this principle ensures consistent, efficient, and accurate information exchange between humans and AI systems.

This meta-language addresses three key aspects of human-AI communication:
1. **Language Type Indicators**: How to identify which formal language a given statement uses
2. **Processing Directives**: How to express intended processing or transformations
3. **Contextual Qualifiers**: How to provide additional context for interpretation

## Language Type Indicators

Language type indicators explicitly identify which formal language a statement uses:

### 1. Inline Type Indicators

Format: `statement (LANGUAGE_TYPE)`

Examples:
- `Calculate the RFM of each customer (NSQL)`
- `∀customer ∈ PremiumSegment, can_access(customer, "premium_features") = TRUE (LOGIC)`
- `ALGORITHM FindOptimalParameters(data, constraints) (PSEUDOCODE)`

### 2. Type Declaration Statements

Format: `statement is LANGUAGE_TYPE`

Examples:
- `Calculate the RFM of each customer is NSQL`
- `The following is pseudocode for customer segmentation`
- `This statement is written in formal logic`

### 3. Block Type Indicators

Format:
```
LANGUAGE_TYPE:
statement
statement
```

Examples:
```
NSQL:
show sales by region
calculate average order value by customer segment
```

```
PSEUDOCODE:
ALGORITHM SegmentCustomers(customers, criteria)
    LET segments = {}
    
    FOR EACH customer IN customers
        LET segment = DetermineSegment(customer, criteria)
        APPEND customer TO segments[segment]
    END FOR EACH
END ALGORITHM
```

## Processing Directives

Processing directives instruct the AI on how to process or transform the provided content:

### 1. Transformation Directives

Format: `statement (LANGUAGE_A) to LANGUAGE_B`

Examples:
- `Calculate the RFM of each customer (NSQL) to SQL`
- `∀x ∈ Customers, active(x) → eligible(x) (LOGIC) to NATURAL_LANGUAGE`
- `Convert this algorithm to pseudocode`

### 2. Processing Request Format

Format: `ACTION statement IN LANGUAGE_TYPE`

Examples:
- `Translate "Calculate the RFM of each customer" in NSQL to SQL`
- `Validate this expression in LOGIC`
- `Debug this code in SQL`

### 3. Multi-step Processing

Format: 
```
LANGUAGE_A:
statement
TO LANGUAGE_B
```

Example:
```
NSQL:
show monthly revenue by product category for premium customers
TO SQL
```

## Contextual Qualifiers

Contextual qualifiers provide additional information about how to interpret or process content:

### 1. Domain Indicators

Format: `statement (DOMAIN: domain_name)`

Examples:
- `Calculate customer lifetime value (DOMAIN: marketing)`
- `Define optimal inventory levels (DOMAIN: supply_chain)`

### 2. Purpose Qualifiers

Format: `statement (PURPOSE: purpose_description)`

Examples:
- `Show sales trends by region (PURPOSE: executive_dashboard)`
- `Calculate churn risk scores (PURPOSE: retention_campaign)`

### 3. Constraint Specifications

Format: `statement (CONSTRAINTS: constraint_list)`

Examples:
- `Show top customers by revenue (CONSTRAINTS: last_quarter, north_america_only)`
- `Generate recommendation algorithm (CONSTRAINTS: real_time, low_compute)`

### 4. Analogy Notation

Format: `X ~ Y` (read as "X is analogous to Y" or "X follows the pattern of Y")

Examples:
- `app_config.yaml->sidebar ~ app_config.yaml->navbar` (The navbar should follow the same configuration pattern as the sidebar)
- `authentication->login ~ authentication->registration` (Registration should follow the same pattern as login)
- `user.filter() ~ data.filter()` (User filtering should work analogously to data filtering)

This concise notation enables rapid communication of implementation patterns, architecture decisions, and design consistency. It's particularly useful for:
- Transferring patterns from existing components to new components
- Ensuring code structure maintains consistency across similar modules
- Applying design patterns uniformly to similar use cases
- Establishing relationships between different parts of the system

## Implicit Conventions

The following conventions apply when explicit indicators are not provided:

### 1. Default Language Assignment

Content is interpreted according to MP0023 Language Preferences based on content type:
- Data manipulation statements → NSQL
- Algorithmic expressions → Pseudocode
- Logical assertions → Formal Logic
- General instructions → Natural Language

### 2. Language Detection

AI systems should attempt to detect the formal language being used based on syntax and structure, applying the appropriate processing accordingly.

### 3. Directive Inference

Common patterns may implicitly indicate directives:
- "Convert X to Y" → Transform X to language/format Y
- "Is this valid?" → Validate expression in detected language
- "What does this mean?" → Translate to natural language

## Meta-Language Equivalences

The following expressions are considered equivalent in this meta-language:

### 1. Type Indicator Equivalences

These type indicators are functionally equivalent:
- `statement (LANGUAGE_TYPE)` ≡ `statement is LANGUAGE_TYPE`
- `LANGUAGE_TYPE: statement` ≡ `The following is LANGUAGE_TYPE: statement`

### 2. Transformation Equivalences

These transformation directives are functionally equivalent:
- `statement (LANGUAGE_A) to LANGUAGE_B` ≡ `translate statement from LANGUAGE_A to LANGUAGE_B`
- `convert statement to LANGUAGE_B` ≡ `statement in LANGUAGE_B`

### 3. Contextual Equivalences

These contextual indicators are functionally equivalent:
- `statement (DOMAIN: domain_name)` ≡ `In the domain of domain_name, statement`
- `statement (PURPOSE: purpose_description)` ≡ `For purpose_description, statement`

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: NSQL Type Indication and Transformation

**User Input**:
```
Calculate the RFM of each customer (NSQL) to SQL
```

**Interpretation**:
1. Identifies "Calculate the RFM of each customer" as an NSQL statement
2. Requests transformation to SQL
3. AI should translate the NSQL to proper SQL for RFM calculation

**Equivalent Alternative**:
```
NSQL:
Calculate the RFM of each customer
TO SQL
```

### Example 2: Multi-statement Processing with Context

**User Input**:
```
NSQL (DOMAIN: e-commerce):
show conversion rate by marketing channel
compare with previous quarter
identify top-performing campaigns
TO DASHBOARD_SPECS
```

**Interpretation**:
1. Identifies all three statements as NSQL in the e-commerce domain
2. Requests transformation to dashboard specifications
3. AI should generate dashboard specs for all three analyses

### Example 3: Implicit Language Detection

**User Input**:
```
Is this valid?
transform Orders to CustomerAnalysis as
  count(order_id) as order_count,
  sum(order_value) as total_spend
  grouped by customer_id
```

**Interpretation**:
1. "Is this valid?" indicates a validation request
2. Statement is detected as NSQL based on syntax
3. AI should validate the NSQL statement for correctness

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Relation to Language Preferences (MP0023)

This principle extends MP0023 by:
1. **Meta-Communication**: Adding a layer for communicating about languages
2. **Explicit Indicators**: Providing explicit methods to indicate language types
