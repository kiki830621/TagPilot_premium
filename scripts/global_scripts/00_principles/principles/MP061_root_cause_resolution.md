# MP107: Root Cause Resolution Principle

## Principle Statement

When solving a problem, identify and fix the root cause rather than implementing exceptions, workarounds, or easier but less effective approaches.

## Detailed Explanation

The Root Cause Resolution Principle emphasizes the importance of addressing the fundamental source of an issue rather than treating its symptoms or implementing temporary workarounds. It requires developers to:

1. **Diagnose Deeply**: Investigate thoroughly to understand the underlying causes of problems before implementing solutions.

2. **Avoid Quick Patches**: Resist the temptation to implement quick fixes that only address symptoms without resolving the fundamental issue.

3. **Resist Easier Workarounds**: Choose the correct solution even when it's more difficult than implementing a simpler workaround.

4. **Fix at Source**: Address issues in their original location where they are created, not where they manifest.

5. **Refactor When Necessary**: Be willing to refactor or redesign components when the root cause is a fundamental design issue.

## Examples

### Good Example: Component Visibility Issue

When components weren't displaying despite being marked as "visible" in the reactive state:

```r
# Root cause fix: Modifying the core display function in Union.R
div(
  id = ns(paste0("display_", comp_name)),
  class = paste0("union-component-display ", comp_name, "-display"),
  # Remove initial hidden style to prevent display issues
  # style = "display: none;", # Initially hidden, will be shown by JS
  
  # Add enhanced rendering container with guaranteed visibility
  div(
    class = "component-content-wrapper",
    style = "display: block !important; visibility: visible !important; opacity: 1 !important;",
    # Component content...
  )
)
```

This approach fixes the actual display mechanism in the Union pattern, addressing the root cause of the visibility issue.

### Bad Example: Component Visibility Issue

```r
# Symptom-treating workaround that doesn't fix the root cause
# Using a periodic observer to force visibility
observe({
  invalidateLater(1000)
  # Force visibility through DOM manipulation without fixing the cause
  shinyjs::runjs('$(".component-display").css("display", "block");')
})
```

This solution merely treats the symptoms by periodically forcing visibility without addressing why components aren't visible in the first place.

## Key Benefits

1. **Long-term Stability**: Solutions that address root causes create more stable and maintainable systems.

2. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Avoiding quick fixes prevents the accumulation of technical debt.

3. **Less Code**: Fixing core issues often requires less total code than implementing multiple workarounds.

4. **Better Understanding**: The process of identifying root causes deepens understanding of the system.

5. **Reduced Regression Risks**: Addressing fundamental issues reduces the risk of related problems recurring.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Ask "why" multiple times to trace through the problem to its origin.

2. Consider if the problem is occurring in multiple places - this often indicates a deeper systemic issue.

3. Test proposed solutions against edge cases to ensure they truly resolve the underlying issue.

4. Document the root cause analysis to help future developers understand why certain approaches were taken.

5. Allocate adequate time for proper diagnosis and resolution rather than rushing to implement quick fixes.

## Related Principles

- **P102: Defensive Error Handling**: Proper error handling helps identify root causes.
- **MP0017: Modularity Principle**: Well-modularized code makes it easier to locate and fix root causes.
- **MP0093: Global Accessibility Principle**: Ensures components are properly accessible, making root causes easier to identify.
- **R19: Component Visibility Guarantee**: Ensures components are visible when they should be.

## Exceptions

The only acceptable exceptions to this principle are:

1. **Critical Time Constraints**: When a temporary workaround is needed immediately, with the understanding that the root cause will be addressed later (and this intent is documented).

2. **External Dependencies**: When the root cause lies in external code/systems that cannot be modified, a workaround may be necessary.

3. **Breaking Changes**: When fixing the root cause would require breaking changes that cannot be implemented at the current time.
