# Replicability Principle

## Statement

All procedures must be replicable, producing identical outputs when provided with identical inputs across multiple executions, regardless of when, where, or by whom they are executed.

## Rationale

Replicability is foundational to scientific reasoning, robust engineering, and trustworthy systems. When processes produce inconsistent results under identical conditions, it introduces:

1. **Uncertainty**: Inability to predict system behavior
2. **Debugging challenges**: Difficult-to-trace errors
3. **Trust erosion**: Diminished confidence in system reliability
4. **Documentation gaps**: Inadequate capture of critical dependencies

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Eliminate Hidden Variables

All factors that influence procedure outcomes must be:
- Explicitly documented
- Passed as formal parameters
- Controlled through configuration
- Versioned appropriately

### 2. Avoid Time-Dependent Behaviors

Processes should:
- Use deterministic random number generation with fixed seeds
- Avoid reliance on system time except when explicitly modeling temporal phenomena
- Document and account for how time affects outputs

### 3. Environmental Independence

Procedures should:
- Function independently of specific user environments
- Document all environmental dependencies
- Include environment setup instructions when dependencies exist
- Use containerization where possible

### 4. Avoid Non-Deterministic Operations

When designing systems:
- Prefer deterministic algorithms
- Document any non-deterministic behaviors
- Use parallel processing carefully to avoid race conditions
- Implement proper synchronization for concurrent operations

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

Verify replicability through:
- Repeated execution testing
- Cross-environment validation
- Continuous integration testing
- Documented test cases with expected outputs

## Relationship to Ambiguity

The Replicability Principle directly addresses ambiguity by:

1. **Enforcing clarity**: When processes must be replicable, their specifications must be unambiguous
2. **Exposing assumptions**: Hidden assumptions become evident when replication fails
3. **Standardizing interpretation**: Consistent outputs require consistent interpretation of inputs
4. **Formalizing procedures**: Converting tacit knowledge into explicit instructions

## Exceptions

The only acceptable exceptions to this principle are:

1. Deliberately non-deterministic simulations that use documented random processes
2. User interface elements designed for variety (when documented as such)
3. Security mechanisms specifically designed to be non-replicable

All exceptions must be explicitly documented, with alternative validation methods specified.

## Examples

### Positive Example

```r
# Replicable data transformation
process_data <- function(data_frame, cutoff_value = 0.05, method = "standard") {
  set.seed(42)  # Fixed seed for any random operations
  
  # Processing logic with explicit parameters
  if (method == "standard") {
    result <- data_frame %>% 
      filter(p_value < cutoff_value) %>%
      mutate(significance = TRUE)
  } else if (method == "alternative") {
    result <- data_frame %>%
      mutate(adjusted_p = p.adjust(p_value, method = "BH")) %>%
      filter(adjusted_p < cutoff_value) %>%
      mutate(significance = TRUE)
  }
  
  return(result)
}
```

### Negative Example

```r
# Non-replicable data transformation
process_data <- function(data_frame) {
  # Uses system time as part of calculation (non-replicable)
  current_hour <- as.numeric(format(Sys.time(), "%H"))
  adjustment_factor <- current_hour / 24
  
  # Uses random numbers without fixed seed
  noise <- rnorm(nrow(data_frame), mean = 0, sd = 0.1)
  
  # Processing with implicit, time-varying behavior
  result <- data_frame %>%
    mutate(value = value * (1 + adjustment_factor) + noise) %>%
    filter(value > mean(value))
    
  return(result)
}
```
