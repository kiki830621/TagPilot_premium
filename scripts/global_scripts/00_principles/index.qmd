# AI MarTech Development Principles

Welcome to the comprehensive framework for principle-driven development in the AI MarTech ecosystem. This documentation system provides structured guidance for building robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.

## Overview {#sec-overview}

This principles framework consists of four main categories:

::: {.callout-note}
## Principle Categories

- **Meta Principles (MP)**: Foundational architectural principles that guide system design
- **Principles (P)**: Implementation principles for specific development practices  
- **Rules (R)**: Concrete implementation rules and coding standards
- **Derivations (D)**: Specific data processing workflows and methodologies
:::

## Quick Navigation

### Core Meta Principles

- @MP018 - Don't Repeat Yourself: Eliminates code duplication
- @MP044 - Functor-Module Correspondence: Maps language commands to code modules
- @MP000 - Axiomatization System: Foundational principle system

### Key Implementation Rules

- @R067 - Functional Encapsulation: Extracts reusable functions
- @R021 - One Function One File: Organizes code modularity
- @R114 - Standard Path Constants: Unified path management system

### Data Processing Workflows

- @D01 - DNA Analysis: Customer behavior analysis pipeline
- @D02 - Customer Filtering: Multi-dimensional customer view creation

## Current Focus: Addressing Code Duplication

Recent analysis has identified significant code duplication in the D-series derivations, particularly between @D01 and @D02. The recommended solution involves:

1. **Applying @MP018** (Don't Repeat Yourself) to eliminate duplicate processing steps
2. **Implementing @MP044** (Functor-Module Correspondence) to create unified data processing modules  
3. **Using @R067** (Functional Encapsulation) to extract shared functions

See @sec-d-series-refactoring for detailed refactoring guidance.

## Cross-Reference System

This documentation uses a comprehensive cross-reference system that enables:

- **Semantic linking**: `@MP018` automatically links to the DRY principle
- **Hierarchical navigation**: Understanding principle dependencies and relationships
- **AI-friendly structure**: Enhanced readability for automated analysis and suggestions

## Recent Updates

- **2025-07-12**: Converted core principles to QMD format for better cross-referencing
- **2025-07-12**: Identified and documented D-series code duplication issues
- **2025-07-12**: Added automated cross-reference system for principle relationships

## Getting Started

For new developers:

1. Start with @MP000 to understand the axiomatization system
2. Review @MP018 for code organization principles  
3. Study the D-series derivations for practical examples
4. Use the search functionality to find relevant principles for specific scenarios

## Contributing

When adding new principles:

1. Follow the established naming convention (MP/P/R/D + sequential number)
2. Include proper cross-references to related principles
3. Add examples demonstrating practical application
4. Update the navigation structure in `_quarto.yml`
