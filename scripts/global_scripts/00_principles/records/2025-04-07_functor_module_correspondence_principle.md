# Functor-Module Correspondence Principle Creation

## Summary

This record documents the creation of the Functor-Module Correspondence Principle (MP44) which establishes a categorical foundation for mapping between domain-specific language commands and implementation modules. This principle recognizes command verb-object pairs as functors that map between domains and provides a consistent framework for organizing implementation modules.

## Background

During the implementation of database documentation functionality as an extension to SNSQL, a pattern emerged where the command `summarize database` naturally corresponded to a module that would implement this functionality. This led to the recognition that command verbs in SNSQL could be systematically mapped to module structures in the codebase.

Further analysis revealed that these commands are not merely verbs but verb-object pairs that act as functors mapping between domains (e.g., from database structures to documentation). This categorical perspective provides a mathematical foundation for organizing code around language semantics.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Meta-Principle Creation**:
   - Created MP44 (Functor-Module Correspondence Principle)
   - Established theoretical foundation based on category theory
   - Defined implementation requirements

2. **Module Naming Convention**:
   - Established naming pattern: `M{number}_{verb}ing_{object}`
   - Provided examples of functor-module mappings

3. **Module Structure**:
   - Defined standard directory structure for functor modules
   - Specified file naming patterns for implementation components

## Rationale

The principle addresses several key needs:

1. **Alignment of Language and Implementation**:
   By mapping SNSQL commands directly to modules, the principle creates a clear relationship between how users express operations and how developers implement them.

2. **Mathematical Foundation**:
   Category theory provides a formal foundation for reasoning about transformations between domains, which is particularly valuable for data-centric operations.

3. **Structural Consistency**:
   Consistent module organization and naming patterns improve maintainability and discoverability.

4. **Composition Support**:
   The categorical approach naturally supports composition of operations, enabling more complex workflows.

## Implementation Details

The principle defines:

1. **Functor Recognition**:
   - Command verb-object pairs (e.g., `summarize database`) are recognized as functors
   - Each functor maps objects from one domain to another (e.g., database → documentation)

2. **Module Structure**:
   ```
   M{sequential_number}_{verb}ing_{object}/
   ├── {verb}_{object}.R          # Main implementation
   ├── sc_{verb}_{object}.R       # Script for direct execution
   ├── {verb}_{object}_utils.R    # Utility functions
   └── README.md                  # Module documentation
   ```

3. **Registration System**:
   - Functors are registered in the SNSQL grammar
   - A manifest tracks functor-module mappings

## First Application

The first application of this principle is for the database documentation functionality:

- Command functor: `summarize database`
- Module name: `M01_summarizing_database`
- Implementation files:
  - `summarize_database.R`
  - `sc_document_database.R`
  - `summarize_database_utils.R`

This demonstrates how an SNSQL command maps to a module structure that encapsulates its implementation.

## Future Work

1. **Functor Registry**:
   - Develop a central registry for all functor-module mappings
   - Include version information and documentation

2. **Composition Support**:
   - Implement mechanisms for composing functors
   - Support piping and chaining of operations

3. **Refactoring Plan**:
   - Identify existing functionality that fits the functor pattern
   - Gradually refactor into the functor-module structure

## Conclusion

The Functor-Module Correspondence Principle provides a mathematical foundation for organizing implementation code around language semantics. By recognizing command verb-object pairs as functors between categories, this principle creates a coherent system where language and implementation are aligned through categorical morphisms.

This approach elevates module organization from a simple naming convention to a deeper structural concept with roots in category theory, enabling more formal reasoning about code structure and behavior.
