# Three-Digit Indexing Plan - April 15, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for converting all Meta Principle (MP) index numbers to a three-digit format to maintain consistency and enable better organization.

## Conversion Strategy

All meta principle index numbers will be padded with leading zeros to create a three-digit format:
- MP00 → MP000
- MP01 → MP001
- MP25 → MP025
- MP67 → MP067

This standardization will ensure:
1. Consistent presentation across all principles
2. Allow for better sorting and organization 
3. Provide adequate space for future expansion (up to 999 principles)
4. Enhance readability and reference clarity

## Implementation Details

The renumbering will be executed using the M00_renumbering_principles module, with a complete mapping table for all existing principles. 

### Example Mapping Table Structure

```r
mapping_table <- data.frame(
  old_id = c("MP00", "MP01", "MP02", ...),
  new_id = c("MP000", "MP001", "MP002", ...),
  name = c("axiomatization_system", "primitive_terms_and_definitions", "structural_blueprint", ...),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

## Special Considerations

1. **Duplicate Base Names**: For files with the same base number but different suffixes (e.g., MP00_axiomatization_system.md and MP00_axiomatization_system_logic.md), both will be converted to the same three-digit format but maintain their distinct suffixes.

2. **Documentation Updates**: Any references to MP numbers in other files will need to be updated accordingly.

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Though this change is primarily structural, it's important to ensure that existing documentation or code references to these files are updated.

## Verification Process

After conversion, a comprehensive verification will be performed to ensure:
1. All file content is preserved
2. All references are updated appropriately
3. No files are lost in the conversion process
4. System consistency checks pass

## Rollback Plan

A complete backup of the principles directory will be created before executing the renumbering operation. If any issues arise, this backup can be used to restore the system to its previous state.
