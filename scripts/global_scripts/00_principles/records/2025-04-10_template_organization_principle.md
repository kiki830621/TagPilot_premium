# Implementation Record: Template Organization Principle and Function File Template

Date: 2025-04-10
Author: Development Team
Principles Applied: MP00, MP01, P95, RC01

## Changes Made

1. Created P95 (Template Organization Principle)
   - Established templates as Rule Composites (RC)
   - Defined sequential organization of template sections
   - Specified section independence requirements
   - Created documentation format for templates
   - Defined benefits and relationships to other principles

2. Created RC01 (Function File Template)
   - First implementation of a Rule Composite
   - Comprehensive template for function files
   - Standardized on Bottom-Up organization (auxiliary functions first)
   - Added section markers using `####function_name####` delimiters
   - Sequential sections following P95 guidance
   - Aggregation of multiple atomic rules (R21, R69, R67, R94)

3. Provided detailed examples for RC01
   - Included examples of Bottom-Up organization pattern
   - Added section markers before each function definition
   - Added both comprehensive and minimal function examples
   - Documented necessary components and sections
   - Included real-world use cases

4. Updated MP01 to include "Section of Script" terminology
   - Added formal definition for script sections
   - Established relationship to LaTeX sectioning commands
   - Incorporated the `####section_name####` syntax into the terminology

## Philosophical Foundation

The Template Organization Principle and Function File Template are founded on:

1. **John Locke's Epistemology**: Complex ideas (templates) are formed by combining simple ideas (atomic rules)
2. **Sequential Processing**: Organization follows a logical progression from identification to implementation
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects of functionality are organized into distinct sections
4. **Modularity**: Each section serves a specific purpose and can be maintained independently

## Benefits

1. **Standardization**: Creates consistent file structure across the codebase
2. **Comprehensiveness**: Ensures all important aspects are addressed in each file
3. **Clarity**: Makes it easy to find specific information in any file
4. **Maintainability**: Enables focused changes to specific sections
5. **Onboarding**: Reduces learning curve for new team members

## Future Work

1. Create additional Rule Composites for other file types:
   - RC02: Module File Template
   - RC03: Configuration File Template
   - RC04: Test File Template

2. Establish a process for:
   - Reviewing and updating templates
   - Testing template effectiveness
   - Collecting feedback on template usage
