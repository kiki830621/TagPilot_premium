## Problem
`cleanse_data.df_amazon_sales` is not being consistently overwritten in the cleansing step.

## Expected Behavior
The cleansed data frame should always be overwritten to ensure fresh data and prevent stale data issues.

## Actual Behavior
The overwrite behavior is inconsistent or conditional.

## Proposed Resolution
Ensure `cleanse_data.df_amazon_sales` is always overwritten in the cleansing step, regardless of existing state.
