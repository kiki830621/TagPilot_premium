## Problem
Need standardized column naming convention for operations.

## Expected Behavior
Column names should follow pattern: `operation__columnname_by_at`
- Double underscore separator
- Clear indication of operation type
- Suffix indicating operation context

## Actual Behavior
Inconsistent column naming across operations.

## Proposed Resolution
Establish and document the naming pattern: `operation__columnname_by_at`
