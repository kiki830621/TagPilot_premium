# Fix Report: ISSUE_137 - Strategy Plot Text Cutoff

## Executive Summary
Successfully resolved text cutoff issue in the Strategic Position Analysis plot by implementing proper margins, expanding plot ranges, and repositioning text elements inward from edges.

## Issue Description
Text in the four-quadrant strategy visualization was being truncated at plot edges, particularly in the bottom-right quadrant (改變/Change), making strategic factors unreadable.

## Root Cause
- **No explicit margins**: Plot used plotly defaults with insufficient padding
- **Edge positioning**: Text placed too close to plot boundaries (x=±5 with range ±10)
- **No text overflow handling**: Long text strings had no wrapping mechanism

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Plot Layout Improvements
```r
layout(
  # Added generous margins
  margin = list(l = 80, r = 80, t = 60, b = 60),
  # Expanded axis ranges from ±10 to ±12
  xaxis = list(range = c(-12, 12)),
  yaxis = list(range = c(-12, 12))
)
```

### 2. Text Positioning Adjustments
- **Quadrant labels**: Moved from x=±5 to x=±4
- **Strategy content**: Moved from x=±5 to x=±3.5
- **Maintained y-positions**: No vertical adjustment needed

### 3. Enhanced Text Formatting
```r
format_keys <- function(keys, max_per_line = 2, max_width = 15) {
  # Added text wrapping for long strings
  # Changed separator from tabs to bullet points
  # Implemented character limit with ellipsis
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `scripts/global_scripts/10_rshinyapp_components/position/positionStrategy/positionStrategy.R`
   - Lines 940-980: Updated plot generation code
   - Lines 128-164: Enhanced format_keys function

## Test Results
✓ Created test script with various text lengths
✓ Generated HTML output for visual verification
✓ Confirmed no text cutoff in any quadrant
✓ Verified proper spacing with Chinese and English text
✓ Tested with empty quadrants and long text strings

## Principles Applied
- **MP073**: Interactive Visualization Preference - Enhanced plot readability
- **MP106**: Console Output Transparency - Ensured all information visible
- **MP099**: Real-time Progress Reporting - Immediate test feedback

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Significantly improved readability of strategy analysis
- **Data Integrity**: All strategic factors now fully visible
- **Visual Balance**: Maintained aesthetic appeal while fixing functionality
- **Internationalization**: Works with both Chinese and English content

## Verification Steps
1. Run test script: `Rscript scripts/global_scripts/00_principles/CHANGELOG/monitoring/test_strategy_plot_fix.R`
2. Open generated HTML: `scripts/global_scripts/00_principles/CHANGELOG/test_data/strategy_plot_test.html`
3. Verify all text is fully visible in all quadrants
4. Check responsive behavior at different screen sizes

## Lessons Learned
1. Always specify explicit margins for plotly visualizations
2. Position text elements with adequate buffer from boundaries
3. Consider text length variability in internationalized applications
4. Test with real-world data containing long attribute names

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing dynamic margin calculation based on text length
2. Add configuration options for margin customization
3. Implement more sophisticated text wrapping for multi-byte characters
4. Create reusable plot margin utilities for other components

## Conclusion
The fix successfully resolves the text cutoff issue while maintaining visual aesthetics and improving overall usability of the Strategic Position Analysis component. The solution follows MAMBA principles and provides a robust foundation for future enhancements.
