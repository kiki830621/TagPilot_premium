# Migration Guides Removal and MP095 Creation

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Type**: Architecture Correction  
**Creates**: MP095 (Claude Code-Driven System Changes)  
**Removes**: CH14_migration_guides directory  
**Author**: Claude  
**Status**: Completed  

## Overview

This change corrects an architectural error where migration guides were incorrectly placed in `CH14_migration_guides/`. According to MP011, CH14 should be "Functions Reference". Additionally, this change establishes MP095 to mandate that all system changes must be executed through Claude Code, prohibiting automated migration scripts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created MP095: Claude Code-Driven System Changes

- **Location**: `natural/en/part1_principles/CH00_fundamental_principles/04_data_management/MP095_claude_code_driven_changes.qmd`
- **Purpose**: Establishes Claude Code as the exclusive mechanism for system changes
- **Key Requirements**:
  - No automated migration scripts allowed
  - All changes require human oversight
  - Changes documented as Claude Code instructions in CHANGELOG
  - Interactive execution only

### 2. Converted Migration Guides to CHANGELOG Format

Moved two migration guides from CH14 to CHANGELOG as Claude Code instructions:

1. **Platform API Architecture Migration**:
   - From: `CH14_migration_guides/MG01_platform_api_migration.qmd`
   - To: `CHANGELOG/2025-08-27_platform_api_architecture.md`
   - Format: Claude Code step-by-step instructions

2. **Platform Numeric to Code Migration**:
   - From: `CH14_migration_guides/MG01_numeric_to_code_platform_migration.qmd`  
   - To: `CHANGELOG/2025-08-27_platform_numeric_to_code_migration.md`
   - Format: Claude Code interactive guidance

### 3. Removed Incorrect Directory Structure

- Deleted: `natural/en/part2_implementations/CH14_migration_guides/`
- Reason: CH14 should be "Functions Reference" per MP011
- Migration guides are temporary and belong in CHANGELOG

## Rationale

### Why This Change Was Necessary

1. **Architectural Consistency**: MP011 clearly defines CH14 as "Functions Reference", not migration guides
2. **Temporal vs Permanent**: Migration guides are time-bound changes; principles are permanent rules
3. **Safety**: Automated migration scripts can cause cascade failures and violate principles
4. **Oversight**: Claude Code ensures human review of every change
5. **Traceability**: Interactive execution maintains clear audit trail

### Benefits

- **Correct Architecture**: Aligns with MP011's three-part documentation structure
- **Safer Changes**: Human oversight prevents destructive automated changes
- **Better Documentation**: CHANGELOG provides temporal context for changes
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Interactive changes help team understand system
- **Reversibility**: Manual changes can be immediately rolled back

```

### Note on Chapter Numbering

There appears to be a discrepancy in chapter numbering:
- CH14_connections exists (should possibly be CH13)
- CH15_functions_reference exists but internally identifies as CH14
- This needs separate investigation and correction

## Validation

### Completed Checks

- [x] MP095 created with comprehensive documentation
- [x] Both migration guides converted to CHANGELOG format
- [x] CH14_migration_guides directory removed
- [x] No broken references to migration guides
- [x] Changes align with MP011 documentation organization

### Principles Compliance

- **MP011**: Documentation organization properly maintained
- **MP034**: Archive immutability respected (no archived files modified)
- **MP095**: This change itself was done through Claude Code
- **MP033**: Principle-guided modifications followed

## Future Considerations

1. **Chapter Renumbering**: Investigate and correct CH14/CH15 numbering discrepancy
2. **Other Migration Guides**: Check for any other misplaced migration documentation
3. **Enforcement**: Ensure team understands MP095 requirements
4. **Training**: Create examples of proper Claude Code interaction patterns

## Key Takeaway

All system changes must now follow MP095: executed through Claude Code with human oversight, documented in CHANGELOG as instructions rather than scripts, ensuring safety, traceability, and principle compliance.
