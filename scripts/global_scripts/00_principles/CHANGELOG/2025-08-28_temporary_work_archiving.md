# Change Log: Temporary Work Archiving Enhancement

## Date: 2025-08-28

## Summary
Enhanced SO_R006 (Archiving Standard Rule) to include comprehensive guidance for archiving temporary work files that have served their purpose but maintain historical value.

## Changes Made

### Updated: SO_R006_archiving_standard.qmd
**Location**: `natural/en/part1_principles/CH01_structure_organization/rules/SO_R006_archiving_standard.qmd`

#### Added Sections:
1. **Section 3: Temporary Work Archiving**
   - Guidelines for when to archive temporary work
   - Archive structure for temporary work files
   - Naming conventions for archived temporary files
   - Archive timing guidelines (immediate vs. batch)

2. **Section 5.4: Temporary Work Archiving Process**
   - Step-by-step process for identifying and archiving temporary work
   - Commands for finding test files, migration documents, and debug scripts
   - Archive manifest creation

#### Enhanced:
- Core Rule to include temporary work archiving as third archiving approach
- Implementation checklist with temporary work-specific items
- Conclusion to emphasize distinction between temporary files (delete) and temporary work (archive)
- Related principles to include SO_R022 (Temporary File Handling) and MP034 (Archive Immutability)

## Rationale

The previous archiving standard focused primarily on deprecated principles and code evolution but didn't address the common scenario of temporary work files that:
- Have completed their primary purpose (test validation, migration, debugging)
- Contain valuable historical context or audit trail information
- Should be preserved but removed from active working directories

This enhancement provides clear guidance for maintaining clean working directories while preserving historical context.

## Impact

1. **Cleaner Working Directories**: Developers now have clear guidance on archiving completed temporary work
2. **Better Historical Context**: Test results, migration plans, and debug insights are preserved systematically
3. **Clear Distinction**: Differentiates between temporary files that should be deleted (SO_R022) and temporary work that should be archived (SO_R006)
4. **Improved Compliance**: Ensures audit trails are maintained for important temporary work

## Examples of Files to Archive

- Test validation files: `test_duckdb_connection.R`
- Migration plans: `MP098_REORGANIZATION_FINAL.md`
- Debug scripts: `debug_connection_issue.R`
- Superseded versions: `app_v1.R` replaced by `app_v2.R`

## Related Principles

- **SO_R006**: Archiving Standard Rule (updated)
- **SO_R022**: Temporary File Handling Rule (handles deletion of truly temporary files)
- **MP034**: Archive Immutability Principle (ensures archives remain unchanged)

## Migration Actions

For existing projects with accumulated temporary work files:
1. Review working directories for completed temporary work
2. Create dated archive directories following the new structure
3. Move files with appropriate documentation
4. Update any references if needed

## Compliance Verification

```bash
# Find potential temporary work files to archive
find . -name "test_*.R" -o -name "*_test.R" | grep -v "tests/"
find . -name "*MIGRATION*.md" -o -name "*REORGANIZATION*.md"
find . -name "debug_*.R" -o -name "*_debug.R"
```
