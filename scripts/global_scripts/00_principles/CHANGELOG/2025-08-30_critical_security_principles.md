# CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE: MP110 and Security Framework

**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Type**: CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT  
**Author**: Principle Revisor  
**Severity**: MAXIMUM  
**Enforcement**: IMMEDIATE - NO EXCEPTIONS  

## Summary

Established **MP110: Security Credentials Management** as a zero-tolerance meta-principle prohibiting all forms of hardcoded credentials in source code. This is a critical security requirement with no exceptions permitted.

## Changes Made

### New Meta-Principle
- **MP110: Security Credentials Management** - Zero-tolerance policy for hardcoded credentials
  - Location: `CH00_fundamental_principles/07_security/MP110_security_credentials_management.qmd`
  - Criticality: MAXIMUM
  - Enforcement: MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS

### New Security Chapter
- **CH07: Security** - Dedicated chapter for security principles and rules
  - Location: `part1_principles/CH07_security/`

### New Security Rules
1. **SEC_R001: No Hardcoded Credentials** - Absolute prohibition of credentials in source code
2. **SEC_R002: Environment Variable Standards** - Naming and usage conventions
3. **SEC_R003: GitIgnore Security Requirements** - Mandatory .gitignore entries

### Security Tools
- **security_audit.R** - Comprehensive security scanning script
  - Scans for hardcoded credentials
  - Validates .gitignore configuration
  - Checks environment variable usage
  - Generates compliance reports

### Documentation Updates
- Updated main index to include Security category
- Added MP110 to navigation guide as CRITICAL principle
- Created security chapter index with enforcement guidelines

## Impact

### Immediate Requirements
1. **All developers** must review and comply with MP110
2. **All code** must be audited for credential violations
3. **All repositories** must update .gitignore files
4. **All credentials** potentially exposed must be rotated

### Enforcement Timeline
- **Immediate**: New code must comply
- **7 days**: Complete codebase audit
- **14 days**: Remediate all violations
- **30 days**: Automated scanning in place

## Violation Response

Any hardcoded credentials found will trigger:
1. Immediate credential revocation
2. Code rejection/rollback
3. Security incident report
4. Mandatory security training

## Compliance Verification

Run the security audit immediately:
```r
source("scripts/global_scripts/00_principles/natural/en/part1_principles/CH07_security/security_audit.R")
report <- run_security_audit(".")
```

## Zero Tolerance Statement

**THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS PRINCIPLE**

This is not a guideline or best practice - it is an absolute requirement. Any attempt to circumvent, disable, or request exceptions will be automatically denied and escalated to security leadership.
