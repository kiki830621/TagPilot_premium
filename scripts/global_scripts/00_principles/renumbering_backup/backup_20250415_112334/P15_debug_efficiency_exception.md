# Debug Efficiency Exception Principle

## Core Principle

**While R21 (One Function One File) remains a fundamental organization principle, debugging efficiency may occasionally warrant limited, well-documented exceptions for tightly coupled components that are frequently debugged together.**

## Rationale

During active development and debugging phases, certain components have such tight coupling that maintaining them in separate files can significantly impede debugging efficiency. This principle establishes controlled exceptions to R21 for specific cases where:

1. Components have inherent cohesion that benefits from co-location
2. Debug cycles frequently require examining multiple components together
3. The overhead of navigating multiple files introduces measurable debugging friction

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Permitted Exception Cases

Exceptions to R21 are permitted only in these specific cases:

1. **UI-Server-Defaults Triple**: 
   - For debugging Shiny modules, the UI-server-defaults triple may be consolidated into a single file
   - This exception applies specifically to R09 (UI-Server-Defaults Triple) implementation

2. **Test Functions**: 
   - Test functions for a specific module may be grouped in a single file
   - This is limited to functions used exclusively for testing

3. **Rapid Prototyping**: 
   - During initial prototyping phases before code stabilization
   - Must be refactored to comply with R21 once the design stabilizes

### 2. Required Documentation

Any file implementing this exception must include:

```r
#' @principle P15 Debug Efficiency Exception
#' @r21_exception This file contains multiple functions as an exception to R21
#' @justification <clear explanation of why the exception is necessary>
#' @refactor_plan <timeline or condition for eventual refactoring to R21 compliance>
```

### 3. Implementation Structure

When implementing this exception:

1. **Naming**:
   - Files must be named to indicate their exceptional status
   - Example: `module_name_triple.R` for UI-server-defaults

2. **Organization**:
   - Group related functions sequentially
   - Use clear section headers to separate functions
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation for each function

3. **Example Implementation**:

```r
#' @principle P15 Debug Efficiency Exception
#' @r21_exception This file contains the UI-server-defaults triple for customer_profile module
#' @justification These components are frequently debugged together during UI adjustments
#' @refactor_plan To be refactored upon stabilization of the module (est. Q2 2025)

#' Customer Profile UI Function
#'
#' @param id Module ID
#' @return UI elements for customer profile
#'
customer_profileUI <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  # UI implementation
}

#' Customer Profile Server Function
#'
#' @param id Module ID
#' @param customer_data Reactive customer data
#' @return Server logic for customer profile
#'
customer_profile <- function(id, customer_data) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    # Server implementation
  })
}

#' Customer Profile Defaults
#'
#' @return Default values for customer profile
#'
customer_profile_defaults <- function() {
  list(
    # Default values
  )
}
```

## Limitations and Constraints

1. **Scope Limitation**: This exception must not be used as justification for broader violations of R21

2. **Refactoring Requirement**: Code using this exception should include a clear plan for eventual refactoring to R21 compliance

3. **Documentation Mandate**: All exceptions must be thoroughly documented with clear justification

4. **File Size Limit**: Files using this exception should still remain reasonably sized (< 300 lines)

5. **Function Count Limit**: Maximum of 3-5 closely related functions per file

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Debugging**: Reduces context switching during intensive debugging sessions
- **Improved Productivity**: Enables faster iteration cycles during active development
- **Practical Balance**: Acknowledges real-world development constraints while maintaining structure
- **Controlled Exceptions**: Provides a formal framework for necessary exceptions

## Relationship to Other Principles

This principle:

1. **Moderates R21 (One Function One File)**: Provides specific exceptions while preserving the general rule
2. **Complements P03 (Debug Principles)**: Enhances debugging capabilities for tightly-coupled components
3. **Supports R09 (UI-Server-Defaults Triple)**: Acknowledges the unique relationship in these components
4. **Respects MP17 (Separation of Concerns)**: Maintains logical separation even when physical separation is relaxed

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: UI-Server-Defaults Triple

For a sales dashboard component:

```r
# sales_dashboard_triple.R

#' @principle P15 Debug Efficiency Exception
#' @r21_exception This file contains the UI-server-defaults triple for sales_dashboard
#' @justification Active UI development requires frequent adjustment of all three components
#' @refactor_plan Will refactor after design sign-off (est. May 2025)

# UI function implementation
sales_dashboardUI <- function(id) { ... }

# Server function implementation
sales_dashboard <- function(id, data) { ... }

# Defaults function implementation
sales_dashboard_defaults <- function() { ... }
```

### Example 2: Test Functions

For customer segmentation testing:

```r
# customer_segmentation_tests.R

#' @principle P15 Debug Efficiency Exception
#' @r21_exception This file contains multiple test functions for customer segmentation
#' @justification These tests are run and modified together during algorithm refinement
#' @refactor_plan Will be refactored after algorithm stabilization

# Test function implementations
test_customer_kmeans <- function() { ... }
test_customer_hierarchical <- function() { ... }
test_segmentation_validation <- function() { ... }
```

## Conclusion

The Debug Efficiency Exception Principle establishes a balanced approach that respects the fundamental organization provided by R21 (One Function One File) while acknowledging practical debugging requirements. By providing a formal framework for limited exceptions, this principle ensures that necessary deviations from R21 are controlled, documented, and temporary, ultimately supporting both code quality and developer productivity.
