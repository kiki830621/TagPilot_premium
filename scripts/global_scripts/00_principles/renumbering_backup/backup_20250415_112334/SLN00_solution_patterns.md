# SLN00: Solution Patterns

## Definition
Solution Patterns (SLN) are documented solutions to common problems, errors, or challenges that arise during development. They provide practical, detailed guidance for addressing specific issues, complete with code examples, anti-patterns to avoid, and connections to relevant principles.

## Purpose
Solution Patterns bridge the gap between abstract principles and concrete implementation by:

1. Documenting proven solutions to recurring problems
2. Creating a knowledge repository of best practices
3. Providing immediate actionable guidance for common errors
4. Connecting practical solutions to their theoretical foundation

## Structure of Solution Patterns

Each Solution Pattern document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Issue**: Clear description of the problem or error being addressed
2. **Root Cause**: Explanation of why the issue occurs
3. **Common Scenarios**: Examples of typical situations where the issue arises
4. **Solution Patterns**: Specific code patterns that solve the problem
5. **Best Practices**: General guidelines for avoiding the issue
6. **Anti-Patterns**: Approaches to avoid
7. **Connection to Principles**: How the solution relates to existing principles
8. **Example Application**: Complete example of applying the solution

## Naming Convention

Solution Pattern documents are named with the prefix "SLN" followed by a number and descriptive title:

- **SLN01**: Handling Non-Logical Data Types in Logical Contexts
- **SLN02**: Avoiding Reactive Context Leakage in Shiny
- **SLN03**: Managing Large Dataset Memory Usage

## Relationship to Other Documentation Types

Solution Patterns complement other documentation types in the system:

- **Metaprinciples (MP)**: High-level conceptual frameworks and design philosophy
- **Principles (P)**: General design guidelines for the system
- **Rules (R)**: Specific implementation rules and conventions
- **Solution Patterns (SLN)**: Practical solutions to specific problems

## When to Create a Solution Pattern

A new Solution Pattern should be created when:

1. A problem or error occurs repeatedly across different parts of the system
2. The solution isn't obvious from existing documentation
3. The fix requires a specific pattern or approach
4. The issue affects multiple developers or components

## Using Solution Patterns

Solution Patterns should be:

1. **Referenced in code comments** when the pattern is applied
2. **Checked first** when debugging common errors
3. **Updated** when new variations of the problem are discovered
4. **Shared** across the development team

## Example Reference in Code

```r
# Following SLN01: Handling Non-Logical Data Types
if (length(tab_filters) > 0) {  # Use length check instead of !tab_filters
  # Process filters
}
```

## Relationship to Principles

Solution Patterns are tightly connected to the existing principle system:

- **MP14 (Change Tracking)**: Solutions document ways to implement changes correctly
- **MP18 (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Solutions prevent reinventing fixes for common problems
- **MP42 (Runnable-First Development)**: Solutions help maintain a runnable application
- **R58 (Evolution Over Replacement)**: Solutions often show how to evolve code safely

By documenting solution patterns, we create a practical knowledge base that complements the theoretical foundation provided by principles and rules.
