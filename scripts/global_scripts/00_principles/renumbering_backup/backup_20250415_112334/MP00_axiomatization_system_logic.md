# Axiomatization System - Logical Formulation

This document presents the logical formulation of the Axiomatization System meta-principle, expressed in formal mathematical language using dependent type theory, model theory, and first-order logic.

## Type-Theoretic Framework

We define our axiomatization system using dependent type theory, which provides a more expressive framework for capturing the relationships between different components.

### 1. Basic Types

First, we define the basic types in our system:

- `Principle : Type` - The type of all principles
- `MetaPrinciple : Type` - The type of all meta-principles
- `Rule : Type` - The type of all rules
- `Guidance : Type` - The supertype of principles, meta-principles, and rules
- `Variable : Type → Type` - Type constructor for variables of a given type
- `Constant : Type → Type` - Type constructor for constants of a given type

### 2. Type Hierarchies

We define subtyping relationships:

```
MetaPrinciple <: Guidance
Principle <: Guidance
Rule <: Guidance
```

### 3. Terms and Relations

We define term constructors and relation types:

```
governs : MetaPrinciple → Principle → Prop
governs : Principle → Rule → Prop
derivedFrom : Guidance → Guidance → Prop
influences : Guidance → Guidance → Prop
implements : Rule → Principle → Prop
extends : Guidance → Guidance → Prop
conflictsWith : Guidance → Guidance → Prop
```

### 4. Dependent Types for Complex Relationships

We use dependent types to capture more complex relationships:

```
Resolution : Π(x y : Guidance), conflictsWith x y → Guidance
Interpretation : Π(x : Guidance)(c : Context), Guidance
CompanyModel : Company → Model
```

## Variables vs. Constants

A key distinction in our type system is between variables and constants:

1. **Constants** (`Constant T`):
   - Have the same interpretation across all company models
   - Examples: MP/P/R numbering scheme, principle hierarchical structure
   - Formally: `∀(c₁, c₂ : Company)(x : Constant T), ⟦x⟧_{c₁} = ⟦x⟧_{c₂}`

2. **Variables** (`Variable T`):
   - May have different interpretations across different company models
   - Examples: implementation details, specific naming patterns, tool choices
   - Formally: `∃(c₁, c₂ : Company)(x : Variable T), ⟦x⟧_{c₁} ≠ ⟦x⟧_{c₂}`

Where `⟦x⟧_c` denotes the interpretation of term `x` in company model `c`.

## Company-Specific Models

We formalize company-specific interpretations using model theory:

```
Company : Type
Model : Type
interpretation : Company → Model
⟦_⟧_ : Π(x : Guidance)(c : Company), Value
```

With the axiom that different companies can have different interpretations:
```
∀(c₁ c₂ : Company), c₁ ≠ c₂ → ∃(x : Variable T), ⟦x⟧_{c₁} ≠ ⟦x⟧_{c₂}
```

## Core Axioms in Type Theory

### 1. Type Disjointness Axioms

```
∀(x : Guidance), ¬(x : MetaPrinciple ∧ x : Principle)
∀(x : Guidance), ¬(x : Principle ∧ x : Rule)
∀(x : Guidance), ¬(x : MetaPrinciple ∧ x : Rule)
```

### 2. Hierarchical Governance Axioms

```
∀(m : MetaPrinciple), ∃(p : Principle), governs m p
∀(p : Principle), ∃(r : Rule), governs p r
```

### 3. Relationship Axioms

```
∀(x y : Guidance), derivedFrom x y → influences y x
∀(r : Rule), ∃(p : Principle), implements r p
∀(x y : Guidance), extends x y → derivedFrom x y
```

## Inference Rules as Type-Theoretic Constructions

### I1. Hierarchical Composition

```
hierarchicalComposition : 
  Π(x : MetaPrinciple)(y : Principle)(z : Rule),
  governs x y → governs y z → indirectlyGoverns x z
```

### I2. Scope Limitation

```
scopeLimitation :
  Π(x y : Guidance)(z : Context),
  limitsScope y x z → ¬(applies x z)
```

### I3. Specificity Precedence

```
specificityPrecedence :
  Π(x y : Guidance),
  conflictsWith x y → specificity x > specificity y → overrides x y
```

## Formalization of Multi-Level Framework

We formalize the MP/P/R and M/S/D frameworks:

```
level : Guidance → Nat
level(m : MetaPrinciple) = 2
level(p : Principle) = 1
level(r : Rule) = 0

Module : Type
Sequence : Type
Derivation : Type
Organization := Module + Sequence + Derivation
```

## Company-Specific Implementation Mapping

For each company, we define an implementation mapping:

```
Implement : Company → Organization → Set Files
```

Where each company may provide different implementations:

```
∀(c₁ c₂ : Company)(o : Organization),
  c₁ ≠ c₂ → Implement c₁ o ≠ Implement c₂ o
```

## System Properties as Types and Propositions

### Consistency

```
Consistency : Type
Consistency := ¬∃(p : Prop), provable p ∧ provable (¬p)
```

### Completeness

```
Completeness : Type
Completeness := ∀(p : Prop), inDomain p → provable p ∨ provable (¬p)
```

## Conflict Resolution as Dependent Type

We can express conflict resolution as a dependent type:

```
Resolve : Π(x y : Guidance), conflictsWith x y → Guidance

Resolve x y conflict =
  match (level x, level y) with
  | (l₁, l₂) where l₁ > l₂ => x
  | (l₁, l₂) where l₂ > l₁ => y
  | _ => match (explicitlyOverrides x y, explicitlyOverrides y x) with
         | (true, _) => x
         | (_, true) => y
         | _ => match (specificity x, specificity y) with
                | (s₁, s₂) where s₁ > s₂ => x
                | (s₁, s₂) where s₂ > s₁ => y
                | _ => requiresPurposeAnalysis x y
                end
         end
  end
```

## Verification Framework

We define a verification framework for checking principle properties:

```
consistencyCheck : Guidance → Bool
completenessCheck : Guidance → Bool
verifyDerivation : Π(x y : Guidance), derivedFrom x y → Bool
```

## Conclusion

This type-theoretic formulation of the Axiomatization System meta-principle provides a precise mathematical foundation that:

1. Properly distinguishes between variables (which can vary across companies) and constants (which remain fixed)
2. Uses dependent type theory to express complex relationships between principles
3. Formalizes company-specific interpretations as different models of the same type system
4. Provides a rigorous framework for verification and derivation

This approach aligns with modern type theory and offers a more expressive framework than pure first-order logic, while maintaining the intuitive structure of the MP/P/R classification system for practical use.
