# Temporary File Handling Rule

This rule establishes specific guidelines for handling temporary files and directories across the precision marketing system, ensuring that temporary artifacts don't accumulate and are properly managed throughout their lifecycle.

## Core Concept

Temporary files and directories should be created with clear intention, used for their specific purpose, and then either deleted or moved to a permanent location immediately after their purpose is fulfilled. By definition, a temporary file should not remain in its temporary location after completion of the procedure that required it.

## Temporary File Principles

### 1. Explicit Lifecycle Management

All temporary files and directories must have a clearly defined lifecycle:

- **Creation**: Created with a specific purpose and clear naming
- **Usage**: Used only for their intended purpose
- **Resolution**: Either deleted or moved to a permanent location
- **Verification**: Confirmation that no temporary files remain

### 2. Naming and Location

Temporary files and directories should be clearly identifiable:

- **Prefix or Suffix**: Use `temp_`, `_temp`, or `_tmp` in filenames or directory names
- **Dedicated Locations**: Store in explicitly named temporary directories (e.g., `temp/`, `tmp/`)
- **Date Stamping**: Include creation date in temporary directory names when appropriate
- **Context Indication**: Include context information in the name (e.g., `temp_renaming_2025-04-02/`)

### 3. Documentation

Document the purpose and lifecycle of temporary files:

- **Purpose Statement**: Document why the temporary file/directory was created
- **Expected Lifespan**: Specify how long the temporary file should exist
- **Resolution Plan**: Document the intended final disposition (deletion or relocation)
- **Ownership**: Clearly identify who is responsible for managing the temporary file

### 4. Information Sufficiency Determination

A file becomes a temporary file if one of these conditions is met:

- **Explicit Designation**: The file was created as temporary with clear naming conventions
- **Information Sufficiency**: All information in file B is now fully included in file A, making B redundant
- **Purpose Fulfillment**: The file's purpose has been fulfilled and its content is no longer needed
- **Superseded Documentation**: Documentation that has been superseded by more formal representations
  (for example, when README files are formalized into principles or rules)

This information sufficiency principle functions as a "principle of sufficiency and minimality" where:
1. We maintain sufficient documentation for the system to function properly
2. We eliminate redundant or superseded documentation to minimize clutter
3. We ensure clear references to the new source of truth when removing redundant files

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Temporary File Creation

When creating temporary files or directories:

```bash
# Create a clearly named temporary directory with datestamp
mkdir -p temp_renaming_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Document the purpose in a README within the temporary directory
echo "# Temporary Directory for Principle Renumbering
Created: $(date)
Purpose: Store backup files during principle renumbering
Resolution: Contents will be moved to records/ after renumbering is complete
Owner: Claude
" > temp_renaming_$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/README.md
```

### 2. Temporary File Resolution

After completing the procedure that required temporary files:

```bash
# Option 1: Delete temporary files when no longer needed
rm -rf temp_directory/

# Option 2: Move valuable content to permanent location
mv temp_directory/valuable_output.md records/2025-04-02_output.md

# Option 3: Archive temporary directory if it may be needed later
tar -czf archives/temp_directory_2025-04-02.tar.gz temp_directory/
rm -rf temp_directory/
```

### 3. Temporary Location Verification

After any procedure that uses temporary files, verify that no temporary files remain:

```bash
# Check for remaining temporary directories
find . -type d -name "temp_*" -o -name "*_temp" -o -name "tmp_*"

# Check for remaining temporary files
find . -type f -name "temp_*" -o -name "*_temp" -o -name "*.tmp"
```

## Common Temporary Storage Patterns

### 1. Procedure-Specific Temporary Directories

For operations that require multiple temporary files, create a dedicated temporary directory:

```
temp_procedure_name_YYYY-MM-DD/
├── README.md  # Documents the purpose and intended resolution
├── backup/    # Contains backups of modified files
├── intermediate_results/  # Contains intermediate artifacts
└── logs/      # Contains operation logs
```

### 2. Application-Level Temporary Directory

For ongoing application operations that need temporary storage:

```
app_temp/
├── cache/     # Cached data with automatic expiration
├── uploads/   # Temporary storage for user uploads
└── exports/   # Temporary storage for generated exports
```

### 3. Temporary Record Files

For operations that generate records that will be moved to a permanent location:

```
temp_records_YYYY-MM-DD/
├── README.md  # Documents the record generation process
├── raw/       # Contains raw output data
└── processed/ # Contains processed records ready for permanent storage
```

## Examples of Violations

The following are examples of violations of this rule:

- **Abandoned Temporary Files**: Leaving `temp_*` files in the repository after the procedure is complete
- **Undocumented Temporary Directories**: Creating temporary directories without README files explaining their purpose
- **Unclear Resolution**: Leaving temporary files without a clear plan for their deletion or relocation
- **Mixed Content**: Storing both temporary and permanent files in a temporary directory
- **Misleading Names**: Naming permanent files with temporary prefixes or suffixes
- **Redundant Documentation**: Maintaining multiple files with the same information without designating which is authoritative
- **Unresolved Sufficiency**: Failing to remove or update files that have been superseded by more formal documentation
- **Missing References**: Removing a file due to information sufficiency without updating references to point to the new location

## Resolution Procedure for Existing Temporary Files

When discovering existing temporary files or directories:

1. **Investigate Purpose**: Determine why the temporary files were created
2. **Assess Value**: Determine if the files contain valuable information
3. **Document Findings**: Document what was discovered about the temporary files
4. **Take Action**:
   - Delete if no longer needed
   - Move valuable content to appropriate permanent locations
   - Archive if historical value exists but active access is not needed
5. **Verify Resolution**: Confirm that all temporary files have been properly handled

### Information Sufficiency Resolution Process

When a file is determined to be temporary due to information sufficiency:

1. **Verification**: Verify that ALL information from file B is truly included in file A
2. **Reference Updates**: Update any references to file B to point to file A
3. **Documentation**: Document the transition and explain where the information now resides
4. **Archiving Option**: Consider archiving file B if it has historical or contextual value
5. **Cleanup**: Remove file B only after completing steps 1-4
6. **Verification**: Verify that the system still functions properly without file B

For example, if a README.md is formalized into a rule (like 13_modules/README.md being formalized into R07):

```bash
# Step 1: Document the transition
echo "# This file has been formalized into R07_module_naming_convention.md
All information previously in this README has been transferred to the official rule.
This file is now considered temporary and will be removed.
Please refer to /update_scripts/global_scripts/00_principles/R07_module_naming_convention.md
for current documentation." > 13_modules/README.temp.md

# Step 2: Archive the original file
cp 13_modules/README.md 13_modules/README.md.archived

# Step 3: Replace with transition message
mv 13_modules/README.temp.md 13_modules/README.md

# Step 4: Schedule for removal after appropriate time
# (after verifying no references to the original file remain)
```

## Relationship to Other Principles

This rule implements the Naming Principles (P05) and derives from:

- **Instance vs. Principle Meta-Principle (MP05)**: Temporary files are instances, not principles
- **Documentation Organization (MP07)**: Guides how temporary file handling should be documented
- **Primitive Terms and Definitions (MP01)**: Establishes the foundational concepts of information sufficiency

It is also related to:

- **Renaming Methods (R05)**: Often involves temporary files during renaming operations
- **Module, Sequence, and Derivation Naming Convention (R07)**: May formalize information previously in temporary README files

## Best Practices

1. **Automation**: Automate temporary file cleanup whenever possible
2. **Verification**: Include verification steps in procedures that create temporary files
3. **Clear Ownership**: Assign clear ownership for temporary file cleanup
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically audit repositories for abandoned temporary files
5. **Immediate Resolution**: Resolve temporary files immediately after their purpose is fulfilled
6. **Documentation First**: Document temporary file handling before creating the files

## Conclusion

Proper temporary file handling ensures that our system remains clean, organized, and free from abandoned artifacts. By treating temporary files with explicit lifecycle management and applying the information sufficiency principle, we maintain system integrity and prevent the accumulation of redundant or obsolete files that can lead to confusion and clutter.

The information sufficiency principle allows us to formalize the natural evolution of documentation from informal notes to structured principles and rules, ensuring that we maintain a single source of truth while properly transitioning between different stages of documentation maturity.
