  #' Transform Customer-Date Aggregated Sales Data to Customer-Level Data (Vectorized)
  #'
  #' @description
  #' This function aggregates sales data that has been grouped by customer ID and date into a customer-level dataset.
  #' For each customer, it calculates:
  #'   - **sum_sales_by_customer**: Overall sum of sales amounts (sum of daily sum_spent_by_date values)
  #'   - **sum_transactions_by_customer**: Overall sum of transactions (sum of daily count_transactions_by_date values)
  #' Additionally, for the fields specified in `first_cols` that exist in the input data,
  #' the function retains the first occurrence (for example, the minimum time, total purchase count, IPT,
  #' and geographic information).
  #'
  #' @param df A data.table (or data.frame convertible to data.table) that has been aggregated by customer ID and date.
  #'           The data must include the following columns:
  #'             - customer_id               : Customer identifier
  #'             - sum_spent_by_date         : Daily sum of sales amounts (from previous aggregation)
  #'             - count_transactions_by_date: Number of transactions for that day (count)
  #'           It is recommended that the following columns also be present for aggregation:
  #'             - min_time_by_date: The minimum payment time across all dates for the customer
  #'             - ni      : Customer's total purchase count (or number of purchases)
  #'             - ipt     : Inter-Purchase Time (days between orders)
  #'           Additional fields (e.g. zipcode, state, lat, lng) may also be present.
  #'
  #' @param first_cols A character vector specifying fields to include in the output.
  #'                   For each such field that exists in the input data, a single value is aggregated for the customer.
  #'                   Special handling is done for "min_time_by_date", "ni", and "ipt" (see details above).
  #'                   Default is c("min_time_by_date", "ni", "ipt", "zipcode", "state", "lat", "lng").
  #'
  #' @param verbose Logical; if TRUE, prints progress messages. Default is TRUE.
  #'
  #' @return Returns a data.table with one row per customer, containing:
  #'         - customer_id                 : Customer identifier
  #'         - sum_sales_by_customer       : Sum of sum_spent_by_date over all days (overall sales)
  #'         - sum_transactions_by_customer: Sum of count_transactions_by_date over all days (overall transaction count)
  #'         - ipt                         : First valid inter-purchase time value for the customer (first non-NA value within group)
  #'         - ni                          : Total number of purchases (maximum value from input rows)
  #'         - min_time_by_date                    : The minimum time across all dates for this customer
  #'         - Additional fields specified in first_cols (if present), taken as the first non-NA occurrence.
