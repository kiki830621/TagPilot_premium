# Temporary Renumbering Backup Archiving

## Summary

This record documents the archiving of temporary backup directories created during the principles renumbering operation on 2025-04-04. Per R05 (Temporary File Handling) and R28 (Archiving Standard), temporary directories should be properly resolved after their purpose is fulfilled.

## Archived Temporary Directories

The following temporary directories were archived:

1. `renaming_backup/` - Empty directory created during the renumbering process
2. `renumbering_backup/` - Empty directory created during the renumbering process

These directories were originally created to store backups during the renumbering operation. The actual backup files were stored with timestamps in their filenames directly in the principles directory.

## Archiving Action

Since the directories were empty and their purpose had been fulfilled, they have been removed from the main directory structure. This record serves as documentation of their existence and purpose, in accordance with R05 and R28.

## Related Operations

This archiving operation is related to the principles renumbering plan executed on 2025-04-04, documented in:
- `records/2025_04_04_principles_renumbering_plan.md`
- `records/2025_04_04_principles_renumbering_execution.md`

The actual file backups with timestamps are preserved as individual `.bak` files in the principles directory.
