# M01: External Raw Data Connection

This module defines standardized methods for connecting to external data sources across different platforms. It provides a unified interface for establishing secure connections to various external data repositories, while encapsulating platform-specific connection details.

## Module Purpose

The External Raw Data Connection module serves as the foundation for data acquisition in the system. It:

1. Establishes secure connections to external data sources
2. Handles authentication and credentials management
3. Implements appropriate connection protocols (JDBC, ODBC, SSH tunneling, etc.)
4. Provides standardized connection functions to be used by derivations and sequences
5. Encapsulates platform-specific connection details behind a unified interface

## Connection Interface

Each platform implementation must provide the following interface functions:

### connect_to_external_source

```r
connect_to_external_source(credentials = NULL, config_path = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
```

- Establishes connection to the external data source
- Returns a connection object appropriate for the platform
- Handles authentication using provided credentials or configuration file
- Reports detailed connection information when verbose is TRUE

### disconnect_from_external_source

```r
disconnect_from_external_source(conn, verbose = TRUE)
```

- Safely closes the connection
- Releases all resources
- Reports disconnection status when verbose is TRUE

### test_external_connection

```r
test_external_connection(conn = NULL, credentials = NULL, config_path = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
```

- Tests if connection can be established
- Returns TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise
- Creates temporary connection if conn is NULL
- Reports detailed test results when verbose is TRUE

## Platform-Specific Implementations

Different platforms may require different connection methods:

### Amazon (01/AMZ)
- Uses AWS SDK for accessing Amazon Marketplace data
- Connects to AWS S3 for report data
- Authenticates with IAM credentials

### eBay (06/EBY)
- May use REST API, JDBC, or SSH tunneling to connect to databases
- Authenticates with OAuth or direct credentials
- Might require SSH tunnels for secure database access

### Cyberbiz (07/CBZ)
- Uses REST API to access Cyberbiz platform data
- Authenticates with API keys
- Processes API responses into usable data formats
