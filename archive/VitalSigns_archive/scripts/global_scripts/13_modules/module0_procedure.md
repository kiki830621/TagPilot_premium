# Module0: Setting Up Project Structure (Claude Prompt Collection)

This document provides prompts for interacting with Claude to help you set up a precision marketing project structure. Each step includes instructions you can directly copy and paste to Claude to streamline the process.

## üöÄ Initial Setup and GitHub Synchronization

### 1. Check Project Structure

```
Please check my project structure. My root directory is /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[company]/. Please show me the files and subdirectories in this directory and tell me if it conforms to the standard precision marketing project structure.
```

### 2. Merge and Organize Utility Directories

```
Please help me merge /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts/utils_old into the utils directory, and merge rshinyapp_utils_old into the rshinyapp_utils directory to resolve duplications and ambiguities.
```

### 3a. Set Up GitHub Repository in Existing Project

```
Let the Company be [company]. Please help me set up a clean GitHub repository integration with Dropbox for an EXISTING project, using the following safer approach:

1. First, clone the repository to a temporary location outside of Dropbox:
   mkdir -p ~/temp_repo
   git clone git@github.com:kiki830621/precision_marketing_global_scripts.git ~/temp_repo/global_scripts

2. Run the Dropbox integration script while the repository is still outside Dropbox:
   cd ~/temp_repo/global_scripts
   bash 12_bash/exclude_git_from_dropbox_noninteractive.sh

3. Create a backup of any existing files in my target location:
   mv /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts_backup

4. Move the properly prepared repository into Dropbox using rsync:
   rsync -av --delete ~/temp_repo/global_scripts/ /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts/

5. Verify that Git operations work correctly after the move:
   cd /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts
   git status

6. Clean up temporary files if everything is working:
   rm -rf ~/temp_repo

Please walk me through these steps, explaining what each command does and any potential issues to watch out for. If you see any way to improve this process further, please let me know.
```

### 3b. Set Up GitHub Repository in New Project

```
Let the Company be [new_company]. I am setting up a completely new precision marketing project and need to clone the global_scripts repository. Please help me set up a clean GitHub repository integration with Dropbox for this NEW project:

1. First, ensure the project directory structure exists:
   mkdir -p /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[new_company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/

2. Clone the repository to a temporary location outside of Dropbox:
   mkdir -p ~/temp_repo
   git clone git@github.com:kiki830621/precision_marketing_global_scripts.git ~/temp_repo/global_scripts

3. Run the Dropbox integration script while the repository is still outside Dropbox:
   cd ~/temp_repo/global_scripts
   bash 12_bash/exclude_git_from_dropbox_noninteractive.sh

4. Move the properly prepared repository into the new project's Dropbox location:
   rsync -av ~/temp_repo/global_scripts/ /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[new_company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts/

5. Verify that Git operations work correctly after the move:
   cd /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[new_company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts
   git status
   
6. Create company-specific configuration:
   mkdir -p /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[new_company]/precision_marketing_app/local_scripts
   cp /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[new_company]/precision_marketing_app/update_scripts/global_scripts/03_config/global_parameters.R /Users/[username]/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/precision_marketing_[new_company]/precision_marketing_app/local_scripts/brand_specific_parameters.R
   
7. Update brand_specific_parameters.R with the new company name and settings

8. Clean up temporary files:
   rm -rf ~/temp_repo

Please walk me through these steps, explaining what each command does and providing any additional steps needed to complete the setup of a new project.
```

### 4. Create Git Synchronization Tool

```
Please create an R script that helps me easily pull and push GitHub changes from within R. Save it as utils/git_sync.R.
```

### 5. Create Dropbox-Git Integration Scripts

```
Please create two bash scripts for Git-Dropbox integration:

1. An interactive version (exclude_git_from_dropbox.sh) that:
   - Finds all .git directories in the precision_marketing folder
   - Renames each .git directory to .git.nosync
   - Creates symbolic links from .git to .git.nosync
   - Adds .dropbox.ignore files with ".git/" entry
   - Updates .gitignore files to ignore Dropbox conflict files
   - Asks for confirmation before processing each repository

2. A non-interactive version (exclude_git_from_dropbox_noninteractive.sh) that:
   - Does the same operations as the interactive version
   - Only processes the current repository without asking for confirmation
   - Suitable for use in automated scripts or during initial repository setup

3. A verification script (git_dropbox_check.sh) that:
   - Checks that .git is a symlink to .git.nosync
   - Checks that .git.nosync is not a symlink (no recursive symlinks)
   - Verifies .dropbox.ignore exists and contains ".git/"
   - Confirms Git operations are working
   - Reports any problems found

All scripts should be saved in the global_scripts/12_bash/ directory and made executable.
```
