# Customer DNA Implementation Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and enhancements made to the Customer DNA implementation for the WISER project to address data structure issues.

## Problem

The initial implementation of Customer DNA analysis encountered the following issues:

1. Missing `buyer_email` column in the `amazon_sales_dta` table
2. Dependency on `item_property_dictionary` table which wasn't available
3. Brittle data cleansing logic that assumed specific column names

## Solution Overview

We implemented the following fixes to make the Customer DNA analysis more robust and adaptable:

1. Enhanced the cleansing function to be more flexible with data structure
2. Added sample data generation for testing
3. Created diagnostic tools to identify database issues
4. Updated implementation scripts to handle edge cases
5. Updated documentation to include troubleshooting guides

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Enhanced Cleansing Function

The updated `cleanse_amazon_dta.R` function now:

- Checks for multiple possible customer identifier columns (`buyer_email`, `customer_email`, `email`, `customer_id`)
- Falls back to `order_id` if no email column is found
- Detects available date, product, price, and postal code columns
- Adapts the query based on available columns
- Provides detailed diagnostic messages
- Handles edge cases gracefully

### 2. Sample Data Generation

Added `create_sample_data.R` with two key functions:

- `create_sample_amazon_data()`: Creates synthetic Amazon sales data with realistic patterns
- `load_sample_data_for_dna()`: Sets up both raw and cleansed databases with sample data

This enables testing the entire DNA pipeline without requiring real data.

### 3. Diagnostic Tools

Created `test_amazon_sales_import.R` in the debug directory that:

- Examines the structure of raw and cleansed data tables
- Lists all available columns
- Checks for critical columns needed for DNA analysis
- Provides recommendations for fixing data issues

### 4. Implementation Script Updates

Updated `implement_customer_dna.R` to:

- Handle missing lineitem_price by creating a default value
- Ensure time column is properly formatted
- Safely handle date range calculations
- Provide more detailed error messages
- Support graceful degradation when some data is missing

### 5. Documentation Updates

Enhanced `module1_1_customer_DNA_implementation.md` with:

- Updated code snippets showing the more robust approach
- New troubleshooting section for data structure issues
- Guidance on using the diagnostic and sample data tools
- More detailed explanations of the data preparation steps

## Testing

Created `test_customer_dna_implementation.R` which:

1. Generates sample data
2. Runs the cleansing function
3. Verifies the cleansed data structure
4. Performs the DNA analysis
5. Enhances the DNA with segments
6. Stores the results in the database

This test script confirms that the implementation works correctly with the expected data structure.

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual WISER data to verify the fixes work in production
2. Consider additional column mapping options for other data sources
3. Add automated validation of the DNA results against business metrics
4. Explore additional customer segmentation options specific to WISER
5. Set up scheduled jobs to refresh the DNA analysis regularly
