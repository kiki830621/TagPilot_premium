# S03: Product Line Mapping

This directory contains documentation for the S03 sequence, which defines the process for creating and maintaining product line mappings across different platforms.

## Sequence Overview

S03 creates a foundational data structure that:

1. Maps individual items (by ASIN or SKU) to their respective product line categories
2. Enables multi-dimensional analysis across platforms and product lines
3. Provides a systematic approach to product categorization
4. Supports the D01 (DNA Analysis) flow by introducing product_line_id_filter in D01_03

## Key Files

- **[S03.md](S03.md)**: Main sequence documentation
- *Implementation Files*: Located in platform-specific directories:
  - `amz_S03_00.R`: Unified product line dictionary for Amazon
  - `ebay_S03_00.R`: Unified product line dictionary for eBay
  - `cyberbiz_S03_00.R`: Unified product line dictionary for Cyberbiz
