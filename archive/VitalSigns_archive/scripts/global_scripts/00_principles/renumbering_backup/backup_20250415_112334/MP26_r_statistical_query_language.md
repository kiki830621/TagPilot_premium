# R Statistical Query Language (RSQL)

## Core Principle

R Statistical Query Language (RSQL) is a hybrid language that combines the data manipulation capabilities of SQL with the statistical analysis power of R, using dplyr-like syntax to express complex statistical operations on data in a readable, consistent manner. RSQL serves as the standard language for statistical analysis operations in the precision marketing system.

## Conceptual Framework

RSQL addresses the gap between general-purpose data query languages and statistical analysis by providing a unified syntax that:

1. **Preserves Readability**: Maintains human readability while expressing complex statistical operations
2. **Combines Paradigms**: Merges SQL's data focus with R's statistical capabilities
3. **Supports Pipeline Pattern**: Employs the pipe operator (`%>%`) for clear operation sequencing
4. **Statistical Focus**: Emphasizes statistical terminology and operations
5. **Implementation Flexibility**: Can be translated to various backends (R, SQL+R, Python, etc.)
6. **R Code Alignment**: Recognizes that better RSQL is ultimately better R code

A fundamental principle of RSQL is that it strives to be as close to well-written R code as possible while maintaining its cross-platform nature. The language does not aim to create arbitrary abstractions but rather to standardize and formalize the patterns of high-quality R statistical code. As the language evolves, it should continually reflect best practices in R programming for statistics.

## Language Specification

### 1. Core Syntax Structure

RSQL operations follow this general pattern:

```r
data_source %>%
  [optional preparation operations] %>%
  [statistical operation] %>%
  [optional post-processing]
```

Where:
- **data_source**: Input data (table, dataset, etc.)
- **preparation operations**: Filtering, grouping, transformation operations
- **statistical operation**: Primary statistical analysis
- **post-processing**: Operations on the statistical results

### 2. Data Preparation Operations

#### Filtering

```r
data %>%
  filter(condition1, condition2, ...)
```

#### Selection

```r
data %>%
  select(column1, column2, ...)
```

#### Transformation

```r
data %>%
  mutate(
    new_column1 = expression1,
    new_column2 = expression2,
    ...
  )
```

#### Grouping

```r
data %>%
  group_by(factor1, factor2, ...)
```

#### Arrangement

```r
data %>%
  arrange(order_column1, desc(order_column2), ...)
```

### 3. Statistical Operations

#### Descriptive Statistics

```r
data %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    mean_x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_x = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_x = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    iqr_x = IQR(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    ...
  )
```

#### Linear Models

```r
data %>%
  linear_model(
    formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2,
    weights = w,
    conf_level = 0.95
  ) %>%
  model_summary()
```

#### Correlation Analysis

```r
data %>%
  correlate(
    vars = c(x, y, z),
    method = "pearson",
    sig_test = TRUE
  )
```

#### Time Series Analysis

```r
data %>%
  ts_decompose(
    time_var = date,
    value_var = sales,
    frequency = "monthly",
    components = c("trend", "seasonal", "remainder")
  )
```

#### Clustering

```r
data %>%
  cluster_kmeans(
    vars = c(x, y, z),
    k = 3,
    iterations = 100,
    seed = 42
  )
```

### 4. Statistical Output Processing

#### Model Assessment

```r
model_result %>%
  assess(
    metrics = c("r_squared", "rmse", "aic", "bic"),
    validation = "cross_validation",
    folds = 5
  )
```

#### Prediction

```r
model_result %>%
  predict(
    new_data = test_data,
    interval = "prediction",
    level = 0.95
  )
```

#### Visualization Preparation

```r
model_result %>%
  prepare_plot(
    type = "diagnostic",
    plots = c("residuals", "qq", "leverage")
  )
```

### 5. Extensions for Advanced Statistics

#### Bayesian Analysis

```r
data %>%
  bayes_model(
    formula = y ~ x1 + x2,
    prior = normal(0, 10),
    iterations = 2000,
    chains = 4
  )
```

#### Machine Learning

```r
data %>%
  ml_model(
    type = "random_forest",
    target = y,
    features = c(x1, x2, x3),
    hyperparameters = list(
      trees = 500,
      mtry = 2,
      min_node_size = 5
    )
  )
```

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Descriptive Statistics

```r
sales_data %>%
  group_by(region, product_category) %>%
  summarize(
    total_sales = sum(sales_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_sales = mean(sales_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_sales = median(sales_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    sales_sd = sd(sales_amount, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_transactions = n(),
    n_customers = n_distinct(customer_id)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sales))
```

### Example 2: Linear Regression Analysis

```r
customer_data %>%
  filter(active_status == "active") %>%
  linear_model(
    formula = lifetime_value ~ recency + frequency + monetary + first_purchase_date,
    conf_level = 0.95
  ) %>%
  model_summary() %>%
  select(
    term, estimate, std_error, t_value, p_value,
    conf_low, conf_high, significance
  )
```

### Example 3: Advanced Time Series Analysis

```r
sales_data %>%
  group_by(date = floor_date(purchase_date, "month")) %>%
  summarize(monthly_sales = sum(sales_amount, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ts_model(
    time_var = date,
    value_var = monthly_sales,
    method = "arima_seasonal",
    horizon = 12
  ) %>%
  forecast() %>%
  mutate(
    prediction_interval_lower = prediction - 1.96 * prediction_se,
    prediction_interval_upper = prediction + 1.96 * prediction_se
  )
```

### Example 4: Customer Segmentation

```r
customer_data %>%
  select(recency, frequency, monetary) %>%
  scale_variables() %>%
  cluster_kmeans(
    k = 4,
    seed = 123,
    iterations = 100
  ) %>%
  bind_to_original(customer_data) %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    avg_recency = mean(recency),
    avg_frequency = mean(frequency),
    avg_monetary = mean(monetary),
    avg_ltv = mean(lifetime_value)
  )
```

## Translation to Implementation Languages

RSQL can be translated to different backend implementations:

### Translation to R/dplyr

```r
# RSQL
data %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(value),
    sd_value = sd(value)
  )

# Direct R/dplyr implementation
data %>%
  dplyr::group_by(category) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    mean_value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_value = sd(value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### Translation to SQL+R

```r
# RSQL
data %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(value),
    sd_value = sd(value)
  )

# SQL+R implementation
# SQL part:
SELECT 
  category,
  AVG(value) AS mean_value_raw,
  COUNT(value) AS count_value,
  SUM(POWER(value - AVG(value), 2)) AS sum_squared_deviations
FROM data
GROUP BY category;

# R part:
result_df$sd_value <- sqrt(result_df$sum_squared_deviations / result_df$count_value)
```

### Translation to Python/pandas

```r
# RSQL
data %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_value = mean(value),
    sd_value = sd(value)
  )

# Python/pandas implementation
data.groupby('category').agg({
    'value': ['mean', 'std']
}).reset_index()
```

## Integration with Other Languages

### Relation to NSQL (MP24)

RSQL complements NSQL by focusing on statistical operations where NSQL focuses on data transformation:

#### NSQL Expression:
```
transform Orders to RegionalSales as
  sum(sales) as total_sales,
  count(order_id) as order_count
  grouped by region
```

#### Equivalent RSQL:
```r
Orders %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(
    total_sales = sum(sales),
    order_count = n()
  )
```

### Relation to Pseudocode (MP22)

RSQL provides statistical implementation where pseudocode describes algorithms:

#### Pseudocode:
```
ALGORITHM CalculateRegressionCoefficients(data, dependent_var, independent_vars)
    LET X = matrix of independent_vars from data
    LET y = vector of dependent_var from data
    LET coefficients = (X'X)^(-1)X'y
    RETURN coefficients
END ALGORITHM
```

#### Equivalent RSQL:
```r
data %>%
  linear_model(
    formula = dependent_var ~ independent_vars
  ) %>%
  model_coefficients()
```

7. **Reproducibility**: Enhances reproducibility of statistical analyses

## Controlled Ambiguity

RSQL acknowledges and embraces a degree of controlled ambiguity, recognizing that statistical analysis inherently involves judgment and interpretation. This controlled ambiguity is a feature, not a bug:

1. **Statistical Judgement**: Different statistical approaches may be valid for the same problem
2. **Implementation Variation**: Different statistical packages may implement algorithms differently
3. **Computational Tradeoffs**: Performance considerations may necessitate approximations
4. **Domain Adaptations**: Domain-specific statistical methods may require flexibility

RSQL focuses on expressing statistical intent clearly while allowing implementation details to vary based on context, available packages, and computational requirements. This balance makes it practical for real-world statistical systems while maintaining conceptual integrity.

## Conclusion

R Statistical Query Language (RSQL) establishes a standardized language for statistical operations in the precision marketing system. By combining SQL's data manipulation with R's statistical capabilities in a readable syntax, RSQL enables clear, consistent expression of complex statistical analyses.

RSQL bridges the gap between data query languages and statistical programming, providing a unified approach that maintains readability while supporting advanced statistical operations. This language enhances the system's ability to perform sophisticated analyses while maintaining clear communication about statistical methods and results.

At its core, RSQL recognizes that the ideal statistical query language is fundamentally aligned with well-written R code—the language aims not to reinvent statistical programming but to formalize, standardize, and extend the patterns that make R effective for statistical analysis while enabling cross-platform implementation.
