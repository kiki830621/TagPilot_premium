# MP38: Incremental Single-Feature Release

## Definition
Each release or update step should introduce only one new feature, component, or substantial change at a time. This ensures that changes are methodical, traceable, and easily reversible if problems occur.

## Explanation
The single-feature release approach minimizes complexity during development and deployment cycles by isolating changes. This principle:

1. Simplifies debugging by limiting the scope of new code that could introduce errors
2. Improves code review quality by focusing attention on one specific change
3. Enables quick rollbacks when problems are identified
4. Creates a clear historical record of how features were introduced
5. Reduces cognitive load for developers and reviewers

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Feature Identification and Isolation

Before implementing changes, clearly define what constitutes "one feature":

```r
# GOOD: One focused change (adding filter validation)
# Add validation to ensure filter values are within allowed ranges
validate_filter_values <- function(filter_values, allowed_ranges) {
  # Validation implementation
}

# BAD: Multiple unrelated changes bundled together
# 1. Add filter validation
# 2. Change UI layout
# 3. Add new data processing function
```

### 2. Change Documentation

Document each single-feature change with clear scope boundaries:

```r
# -----------------------------------------------
# UPDATE (2025-04-07): Add filter validation only
# -----------------------------------------------
# This change introduces input validation for filter values
# No UI changes or data processing modifications are included
```

### 3. Feature Batching

When multiple small changes are needed, create a logical batching strategy:

```r
# PHASE 1: Input validation features only
# - validate_filter_values()
# - show_validation_feedback()
# - handle_validation_errors()

# PHASE 2: UI enhancements only (separate release)
# - update_filter_layout()
# - add_validation_styling()
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Each change is more manageable and easier to understand
2. **Traceability**: Clear history of how the application evolved
3. **Quality**: More focused testing and review for each change
4. **Stability**: Lower risk of introducing multiple interacting bugs
5. **Learning**: Team members can more easily understand incremental changes
6. **Recovery**: Simpler rollback process when issues are identified

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Feature Creep During Implementation

Avoid:
```r
# Started implementing filter validation but added unplanned features
function add_filter_validation() {
  # Original validation logic
  
  # Unplanned: Also changed the UI layout
  # Unplanned: Also added new data processing
}
```

### 2. Bundled Unrelated Changes

Avoid:
```r
# Commit message: "Various improvements"
# - Changed database schema
# - Updated UI colors
# - Added new reporting feature
# - Fixed five unrelated bugs
```

### 3. Excessive Breaking Changes

Avoid:
```r
# Changed multiple interfaces simultaneously
# - Renamed all filter functions
# - Changed parameter orders
# - Restructured return values
# - Modified database schema
```

## Implementation Process

1. **Identify**: Clearly define the single feature or change to implement
2. **Isolate**: Ensure the change doesn't require or include other changes
3. **Implement**: Make the minimal necessary modifications
4. **Document**: Clearly describe what changed and what didn't
5. **Test**: Verify only the intended functionality changed
6. **Release**: Deploy the single change
7. **Verify**: Confirm successful operation before starting the next change
