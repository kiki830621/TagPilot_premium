# M48: Functionalizing Module

## Purpose
The Functionalizing Module provides tools and patterns for converting procedural code blocks into proper encapsulated functions, following the functional programming paradigm established in MP47. This module helps maintain code quality by ensuring that function-like code is properly encapsulated, documented, and stored according to project principles.

## Core Functionality
The module provides tools to:
1. Analyze procedural code to identify inputs, outputs, and purpose
2. Generate appropriate function signatures and documentation
3. Create properly formatted function files in the appropriate directories
4. Generate equivalent usage code that preserves the original behavior
5. Maintain scope and context when extracting code into functions

## Implementation
The primary function in this module is `functionalize()`, which takes procedural code and converts it to a proper function in a dedicated file:

```r
functionalize <- function(code_block, target_directory, function_name = NULL, description = NULL, parameters = NULL)
```

Parameters:
- `code_block`: The procedural code block to functionalize
- `target_directory`: The directory where the function file should be created
- `function_name`: Optional name for the function (will be derived from code if not provided)
- `description`: Optional description of the function purpose
- `parameters`: Optional parameter descriptions

A wrapper function `run_functionalization()` is also provided for ease of use.

## Important Note on Variable Scope
When functionalizing code, it's crucial to consider the scope of variables:

1. **Local Variables**: Variables that are only used within the function should be declared with the standard assignment operator (`<-`).

2. **Global Variables**: Variables that need to be accessible outside the function or modify global state should use the superassignment operator (`<<-`).

3. **Preserving Global State**: If a code block interacts with global variables (like a registry or shared state), the functionalized version must explicitly handle this through:
   - Proper use of `<<-` for global assignments
   - Alternatively, adding formal parameters to pass global variables by reference

Example handling global state:
```r
# Original code with global state
my_global_var <- NULL
code_that_modifies_global_var()

# Functionalized version
initialize_global_state <- function() {
  my_global_var <<- NULL  # Uses <<- to modify the global variable
  code_that_modifies_global_var()
}
```

## Related Principles
This module implements:
- MP47 (Functional Programming Metaprinciple)
- R67 (Functional Encapsulation Rule)
- R21 (One Function One File)
- MP17 (Separation of Concerns)

## Usage Example
When a procedural code block like this is identified:

```r
# Calculate product metrics
data <- read.csv("products.csv")
metrics <- data.frame(
  product_id = data$product_id,
  revenue = data$price * data$quantity,
  profit_margin = (data$price - data$cost) / data$price
)
write.csv(metrics, "product_metrics.csv")
```

The functionalize module can convert it to a proper function:

```r
# Created function file: fn_calculate_product_metrics.R
calculate_product_metrics <- function(input_file, output_file) {
  data <- read.csv(input_file)
  metrics <- data.frame(
    product_id = data$product_id,
    revenue = data$price * data$quantity,
    profit_margin = (data$price - data$cost) / data$price
  )
  write.csv(metrics, output_file)
}
```

And generate equivalent usage code:

```r
# Equivalent usage
calculate_product_metrics("products.csv", "product_metrics.csv")
```

## Workflow
1. Identify procedural code blocks that should be functionalized
2. Call the `functionalize()` function with the code block
3. Review the generated function and its suggested usage
4. Implement the suggested usage in place of the original code

## Function Placement
IMPORTANT: When functionalizing code, always place the new function file in the appropriate directory:

1. Function files should be placed in `/update_scripts/global_scripts/00_functions/` or other appropriate functional directories, NOT in the `00_principles` directory.
2. When functionalizing code from a principle file, leave a reference comment in the original file pointing to the function's new location.
3. Use the following naming convention for the reference:
   ```
   # This is a reference to the function that has been functionalized
   # Function has been moved to the proper location at:
   # /update_scripts/global_scripts/[destination_folder]/[function_name].R
   ```
4. All functionalizing operations must properly relocate code from principles to appropriate functional directories while maintaining traceability.
