# Change Tracking Principle

This meta-principle establishes that all system changes must be tracked, versioned, and recoverable across the precision marketing system, ensuring auditability, recoverability, and collaborative development.

## Core Concept

All changes to code, configuration, principles, and data within the precision marketing system must be tracked, versioned, and recoverable through appropriate version control mechanisms. This implements a comprehensive audit trail and recovery capability that enables collaboration, ensures system integrity, and prevents irreversible loss of work.

## Multi-Level Version Control Framework

### 1. Hierarchical Version Control Structure

The system implements a dual-level version control framework that operates according to the nature and purpose of the content:

| Content Type | Storage Location | Version Control Mechanism | Recovery Capability | Synchronization |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Code & Principles** | Global Scripts Repository | Git | Full history with commit-level granularity | Push/pull with remote repository |
| **Project Data & Config** | Dropbox | Dropbox Version History | 30/180 days of version history depending on plan | Automatic cloud synchronization |
| **Local Development** | Local Environment | Local Git + Project .gitignore | Granular commits before pushing | Manual synchronization via git |

### 2. Version Control Scope

#### 2.1 Content Under Version Control

All of the following must be placed under appropriate version control:

1. **Code**
   - All scripts, functions, and modules
   - Application components and UI elements
   - Configuration scripts and utilities

2. **Documentation**
   - All principles (MP, P, R documents)
   - Module and sequence documentation
   - Implementation guides and README files

3. **Configuration**
   - YAML configuration files
   - Database connection parameters (excluding credentials)
   - Environment and mode settings

4. **Processed Data Assets**
   - Generated analytical outputs
   - Data transformations 
   - Visualization templates

#### 2.2 Exclusions from Version Control

The following should be explicitly excluded from version control:

1. **Sensitive Information**
   - Authentication credentials
   - API keys and tokens
   - Personal identifiable information

2. **Temporary Files**
   - Cache and temporary working files
   - Session-specific data
   - Log files

3. **Large Binary Data**
   - Raw data files above repository size limits
   - Large media files (images, videos)
   - Generated reports for distribution

### 3. Git Implementation for Code and Principles

For the global_scripts repository and all code-related assets:

#### 3.1 Commit Guidelines

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Commit messages must clearly describe:
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - Reference to relevant principles or issues
3. **Regular Cadence**: Commits should be made at natural completion points
4. **Pre-Push Testing**: Code should be tested before pushing to shared repositories

#### 3.2 Branch Strategy

1. **Main Branch**: Represents the stable, production-ready state of the system
2. **Development Branches**: Feature or fix-specific branches for ongoing work
3. **Release Branches**: For preparing and testing specific releases
4. **Company-Specific Branches**: For company-specific implementations

#### 3.3 Merge and Review Process

1. **Code Review**: Changes should be reviewed before merging to main branches
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts must be resolved with careful consideration of both sources
3. **Testing Requirement**: Automated tests should pass before merging

### 4. Dropbox Implementation for Project Data

For project data and larger assets stored in Dropbox:

#### 4.1 Folder Structure

1. **Clear Organization**: Maintain the established folder hierarchy 
2. **Version Indicators**: Include version indicators in folder or file names for major versions
3. **Archive System**: Move outdated versions to archive folders rather than deleting

#### 4.2 Change Documentation

1. **Change Logs**: Maintain README or change log files in relevant directories
2. **Version Notes**: Document significant version changes in accompanying text files
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent date-based naming for versions

### 5. Hybrid Approach for Complex Projects

For projects requiring both code and data version control:

1. **Git for Code**: Store all code and configuration in Git
2. **Dropbox for Data**: Store large data files and assets in Dropbox
3. **Reference Links**: Use relative path references or configurable paths to link between systems
4. **Synchronization Points**: Document the version compatibility between code and data assets

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Backup and Recovery Strategy

#### 1.1 Regular Backups

1. Automated daily backups of the entire system
2. Weekly full backups stored in offsite locations
3. Backup verification and recovery testing

#### 1.2 Recovery Process

1. Document step-by-step recovery procedures for different failure scenarios
2. Maintain recovery time objectives for critical components
3. Test recovery procedures quarterly

### 2. Synchronization Protocol

#### 2.1 Synchronization Cadence

1. **Development Work**: Push/pull at least daily when actively developing
2. **Critical Changes**: Immediate synchronization for security or critical fixes
3. **Regular Updates**: Scheduled synchronization for routine updates

#### 2.2 Conflict Management

1. **Detection**: Implement processes to detect synchronization conflicts
2. **Resolution**: Document the hierarchy of truth for conflict resolution
3. **Prevention**: Use locking mechanisms where appropriate to prevent simultaneous edits

### 3. Audit Requirements

#### 3.1 Change Audit Trail

1. **Who**: Identify who made each change
2. **What**: Document what was changed
3. **When**: Record timestamp of changes
4. **Why**: Require documentation of purpose for significant changes

#### 3.2 Retention Policy

1. **Code History**: Permanent retention of all code change history
2. **Principle Changes**: Permanent retention of all principle version history
3. **Configuration Changes**: Minimum 3-year retention of configuration changes
4. **Development Artifacts**: Minimum 1-year retention of development artifacts

## Relationship to Legal Frameworks

This principle operates as a "chain of custody" in legal terms, ensuring:

1. **Provenance**: The origin of all system components can be traced
2. **Integrity**: Changes are verifiable and authenticated
3. **Non-repudiation**: Changes cannot be denied or repudiated by their authors
4. **Recoverability**: Previous states can be restored if needed

## Relationship to Other Principles

This meta-principle relates to:

1. **Axiomatization System** (MP00): Ensures the evolution of the axiomatic system itself is tracked
2. **Statute Law Analogy** (MP13): Provides the "legislative history" that is crucial for legal interpretation
3. **Data Integrity Principle** (P02): Reinforces data integrity through change tracking and audit
4. **Deployment Patterns** (P08): Governs how versioned code is deployed to environments

## Benefits of Change Tracking

1. **Recoverability**: Ability to recover from errors or data corruption
2. **Accountability**: Clear record of who made what changes and when
3. **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same system
4. **Knowledge Retention**: Preserves institutional knowledge over time
5. **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements for change management
6. **Experimentation**: Provides safety net for experimental changes

## Example Application

### Applying Change Tracking to Principle Evolution

Consider how this applies to the evolution of principles themselves:

1. **Initial Documentation**: The principle is created and committed to the repository
2. **Amendment Tracking**: Changes are proposed through branching and pull requests
3. **Review Process**: Changes undergo review before merging
4. **Change History**: Git history preserves the evolution of the principle
5. **Precedent Documentation**: Interpretations and applications are documented in the repository
6. **Recovery Capability**: Previous versions can be consulted or restored if needed

### Multi-System Recovery Process

For a complex recovery involving both code and data:

1. **Identify Failure Point**: Determine when and where the issue occurred
2. **Code Recovery**: Restore code to the appropriate commit from Git
3. **Data Recovery**: Restore data files to the matching point in time from Dropbox
4. **Configuration Alignment**: Ensure configuration files are compatible with both restored versions
5. **Verification**: Test the recovered system for functionality
6. **Documentation**: Record the recovery process and outcome

## Conclusion

By establishing comprehensive change tracking across all system levels, this meta-principle ensures that the precision marketing system maintains full auditability, recoverability, and collaborative capability. This creates a robust foundation for ongoing development, protects against data loss, and ensures that the system can evolve while maintaining a complete history of its development.
