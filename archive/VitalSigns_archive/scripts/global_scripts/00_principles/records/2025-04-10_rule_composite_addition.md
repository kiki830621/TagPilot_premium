Date: 2025-04-10
Author: Development Team
Principles Applied: MP00, MP01

## Changes Made

1. Extended the MP/P/R framework to include Rule Composites (RC)
   - Added Rule Composite (RC) as a new classification level
   - Defined its relationship to other classification levels
   - Created mapping to traditional axiomatic concepts (lemmas & applied theorems)
   - Updated cross-referencing system to include RC notation

2. Added John Locke's epistemology as philosophical foundation
   - Drew parallel between Locke's simple/complex ideas and our atomic/composite rules
   - Added explicit reference to Locke's theory in the axiomatization system
   - Established theoretical foundation for rule aggregation patterns

3. Updated MP00 (Axiomatization System) documentation
   - Added RC to principle framework table
   - Added detailed description of Rule Composites
   - Updated document structure examples to include RC-specific fields
   - Added "aggregates" relationship for tracking rule composition

## Philosophical Foundation

The Rule Composite concept is philosophically grounded in John Locke's epistemology, specifically:

1. **Simple vs. Complex Ideas**: Locke distinguished between simple ideas (received directly through sensation) and complex ideas (formed by the mind through combination of simple ideas)

2. **Mental Operations**: Locke described how the mind forms complex ideas through operations like combination, comparison, and abstraction

3. **Knowledge Construction**: Locke's theory describes how knowledge is built from basic sensory inputs to sophisticated understanding through mental processing

In our framework:
- Atomic Rules (R) function like Locke's simple ideas - basic, atomic units of implementation guidance
- Rule Composites (RC) function like Locke's complex ideas - sophisticated combinations that address multiple implementation concerns coherently
- The process of creating RCs mirrors Locke's description of how the mind forms complex ideas from simple ones

## Rule Composite Definition

A Rule Composite (RC) is defined as:

1. A coherent template or pattern that integrates multiple atomic rules 
2. A comprehensive implementation guide that addresses multiple concerns simultaneously
3. A higher-level abstraction built from the combination of simpler rules
4. A reusable pattern that shows how multiple rules work together effectively

## Benefits of Rule Composites

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: Avoids repeating the same combinations of rules across documentation
2. **Increased Coherence**: Ensures rules are applied together in compatible ways
3. **Better Comprehension**: Makes it easier to understand how rules work together
4. **Practical Templates**: Provides ready-to-use patterns for implementation
5. **Philosophical Grounding**: Aligns our system with established epistemological frameworks

## Implementation Steps

1. Rule Composites will be documented as RC followed by a number (e.g., RC01)
2. Each RC document must specify which atomic rules it aggregates
3. RC documents should demonstrate how the atomic rules work together
4. The first RC to be created will be the Function Template (RC01)

## Future Work

1. Create RC01 (Function Template) as the first Rule Composite
2. Review existing documentation for patterns that should be formalized as RCs
3. Develop a consistent documentation format specific to RCs
4. Consider how RCs relate to the Module/Sequence/Derivation framework
