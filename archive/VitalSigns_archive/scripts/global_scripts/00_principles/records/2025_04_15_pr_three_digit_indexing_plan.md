# Principle and Rule Three-Digit Indexing Plan - April 15, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for converting all Principle (P) and Rule (R) index numbers to a three-digit format to maintain consistency with the Meta Principles (MP) that were already converted.

## Conversion Strategy

All principle and rule index numbers will be padded with leading zeros to create a three-digit format:
- P00 → P000
- P01 → P001
- P99 → P099
- R01 → R001
- R99 → R099
- P_R100 → P_R100 (special case - combined files)

This standardization will ensure:
1. Consistent presentation across all principles and rules
2. Alignment with the Meta Principles numbering scheme
3. Better sorting and organization in file listings
4. Adequate space for future expansion (up to 999 principles/rules)
5. Enhanced readability and reference clarity

## Implementation Details

The conversion will be executed using a custom R script (`execute_pr_three_digit_conversion.R`) that will perform the following operations:

1. Create a backup of all P*.md and R*.md files
2. Convert the filenames to the three-digit format
3. Update internal references within each file
4. Handle special cases like P_R combined files

## Special Considerations

1. **Duplicate Base Numbers**: For files with the same base number but different suffixes (e.g., P05_case_sensitivity_principle.md and P05_naming_principles.md), both will be converted to the same three-digit format but maintain their distinct suffixes.

2. **Combined Files**: Files that follow the pattern P_R###_something.md will have special handling to maintain their unique format while still converting to three digits.

3. **Documentation Updates**: All references to P and R numbers in other files will be updated to reflect the new three-digit format.

## Verification Process

After conversion, a comprehensive verification will ensure:
1. All file content is preserved
2. All references are updated appropriately
3. No files are lost in the conversion process
4. Consistent formatting across all P, R, and MP files

## Rollback Plan

A complete backup of all P and R files will be created before executing the renumbering operation. If any issues arise, this backup can be used to restore the files to their previous state.
