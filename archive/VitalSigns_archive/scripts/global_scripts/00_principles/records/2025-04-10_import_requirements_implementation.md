# Implementation of R95 Import Requirements Rule

**Date:** 2025-04-10  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Principle:** R95 Import Requirements Rule  

## Summary

This document describes the implementation of R95 (Import Requirements Rule) that centralizes package management across the application. The implementation follows the principle of MP31 (Initialization First) by moving all package imports into the initialization phase of the application.

## Changes Made

1. Revised the R95 Import Requirements Rule document:
   - Updated the Core Statement to emphasize centralized initialization-based imports
   - Modified the implementation approach to use centralized initialization scripts
   - Added clear examples of initialization-based package management
   - Expanded sections on benefits, integration, and implementation checklist
   - Added reference to MP31 (Initialization First)

2. Created a new centralized package initialization function:
   - Implemented `fn_initialize_packages.R` as a central package management system
   - Organized packages into functional groups (core, db, ui, processing, etc.)
   - Added robust error handling and reporting
   - Implemented mode-based package loading (APP_MODE, UPDATE_MODE, DEV_MODE, TEST_MODE)
   - Exposed AVAILABLE_PACKAGES global object for dependency checking

3. Modified initialization script (`sc_initialization_app_mode.R`):
   - Removed direct package loads via library2() calls
   - Implemented centralized package management through initialize_packages()
   - Added validation to ensure packages are properly loaded

4. Updated app.R:
   - Added reference to R95 in the file header
   - Improved initialization section documentation
   - Added validation to check if package initialization succeeded
   - Removed direct package loading

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All package dependencies are now defined in one location
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated redundant package loading across different files
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Package updates only need to be made in one place
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Centralized error handling for package loading failures
5. **Simplified Onboarding**: New developers can easily see all required packages
6. **Better Dependency Management**: Clear organization of packages by function

## Future Improvements

1. Consider creating a package version manifest file for tracking required versions
2. Implement a package verification step to ensure package versions are compatible
3. Extend the system to automatically install missing packages in development mode
4. Add dependency tracking to detect unnecessary or redundant package imports

## Lessons Learned

1. Centralizing package management improves application stability
2. Following MP31 (Initialization First) simplifies application startup logic
3. Explicit package grouping makes dependencies more transparent
4. Function-based package initialization allows for better error handling
