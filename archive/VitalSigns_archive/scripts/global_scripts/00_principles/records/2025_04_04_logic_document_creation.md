# Logic Document Creation Standard

## Summary

This record documents the creation of a formal rule (R24) for establishing and maintaining logical formulations of principles and meta-principles. The changes include:

1. Creating R24 (Logic Document Creation Rule) to define standards for logical formulation documents
2. Creating a logical formulation of MP00 (Axiomatization System) as an example
3. Establishing naming conventions and required elements for logical documents
4. Defining the process for keeping logical and natural language documents synchronized
5. Implementing proper type theory foundations with distinction between variables and constants

## Motivation

These changes were motivated by the need to:

1. Provide formal, mathematical expressions of key principles to remove ambiguity
2. Support formal verification of principle consistency and completeness
3. Enable rigorous derivation of consequences from established principles
4. Bridge the gap between natural language descriptions and formal methods
5. Implement the vision outlined in MP20 (Principle Language Versions) and MP21 (Formal Logic Language)
6. Address the insight that different companies represent different structures in the model-theoretic sense
7. Properly distinguish between variables (which can vary by company) and constants (which remain fixed)

## Changes Made

### 1. Created R24 (Logic Document Creation Rule)

- Established requirements for creating logical formulation documents
- Defined naming conventions for logical documents (`[Original ID]_logic.md`)
- Specified required YAML frontmatter fields including `alternative_of` relationship
- Provided guidelines for logical notation and formalism using type theory
- Set maintenance and synchronization requirements

### 2. Created MP00_axiomatization_system_logic.md

- Implemented a logical formulation of the Axiomatization System meta-principle
- Used dependent type theory as the foundation
- Formalized the principle framework as type hierarchies
- Defined formal type-theoretic axioms for principle relationships
- Expressed inference rules as logical deduction rules
- Distinguished between variables and constants in the type system
- Formalized company-specific implementations using model theory and interpretations

### 3. Established Type Theory Notation Standards

- Type theory notation (x: T for "x is of type T")
- Dependent types notation (Π(x:A), B(x))
- Subtyping notation (S <: T)
- First-order logic notation (∀, ∃, ∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔)
- Set theory notation (∈, ⊆, ∩, ∪, ∖, ℘)
- Interpretation notation (⟦x⟧_c for interpreting x in company model c)
- Distinction between variables and constants
- LaTeX math formatting guidelines

### 4. Created Maintenance and Synchronization Guidelines

- Requirement to update logical documents within 5 days of natural language updates
- Cross-validation process to ensure consistency between versions
- Version control recommendations for simultaneous updates

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits

1. **Precision**: Removes ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions
2. **Formal Verification**: Enables mathematical verification of principle consistency
3. **Rigorous Derivation**: Allows formal derivation of consequences and implications
4. **Company Structure Modeling**: Provides a framework to model company-specific implementations
5. **Technical Bridge**: Creates connections to formal methods and verification tools
6. **Clarification**: Reveals and addresses hidden assumptions in natural language
7. **Variable-Constant Distinction**: Clearly distinguishes between elements that vary by company and those that remain fixed

### Implications

1. **Maintenance Overhead**: Creates an additional document to maintain for each principle
2. **Expertise Requirement**: Requires knowledge of type theory, formal logic, and model theory
3. **Synchronization Challenge**: Requires vigilance to keep logical and natural language versions aligned
4. **Tool Support Needs**: May require additional tools for validation and verification

## Relationship to Other Components

These changes relate to:

1. **Principle Language Versions (MP20)**: Implements the vision of maintaining multiple formal expressions
2. **Formal Logic Language (MP21)**: Provides concrete guidelines for formal logical expressions
3. **Primitive Terms and Definitions (MP01)**: Formalizes the foundational terminology
4. **Axiomatization System (MP00)**: Strengthens the axiomatic framework with formal rigor

## Conclusion

The creation of R24 (Logic Document Creation Rule) and the accompanying example implementation for MP00 establish a framework for formal logical expressions of principles within the precision marketing system. This dual approach of maintaining both natural language and formal logical versions combines intuitive understanding with mathematical precision.

By adopting type theory and properly distinguishing between variables and constants, we've created a powerful framework to express how different companies can represent different model-theoretic structures while sharing the same logical foundation. This enables more rigorous reasoning about principle application across diverse contexts, ensuring both consistency where needed and flexibility where appropriate.

The resulting system gains in precision, verifiability, and formal derivation power while maintaining the accessibility of natural language descriptions.
