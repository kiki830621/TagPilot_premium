# D03: Positioning Analysis

This directory contains documentation and implementation resources for the Positioning Analysis derivation (D03). The positioning analysis enables comparison of product attributes, ratings, and market performance across brands and product lines.

## Key Files

- **[D03.md](D03.md)**: The complete derivation flow documentation
- **platforms/**: Platform-specific implementations (when available)

## Overview

The positioning analysis derivation processes review data to extract sentiment and rating information for specific product attributes. This information is then combined with sales data to create a comprehensive positioning analysis that helps identify strengths, weaknesses, and competitive advantages across different products and brands.

## Components

The positioning data is visualized in the application using:

- **positionTable**: Interactive data table with filtering capabilities
- **positionChart**: (Future) Visual chart representation of positioning data

## Adding New Data

To add new product lines to the positioning analysis:

1. Update the product line information in `app_data.parameters.product_line.csv`
2. Import the relevant item properties and reviews
3. Process the data through the D03 derivation steps
4. The positionTable component will automatically display the new data when the product line is selected
