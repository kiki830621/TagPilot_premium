# Vectorization Principle

## Core Principle

Vectorization is a fundamental paradigm in R programming that prioritizes operations on entire vectors, matrices, and data frames rather than individual elements. When working with R, design code to leverage vectorized operations whenever possible, minimizing explicit iteration.

## Rationale

The vectorization principle is central to effective R programming for the following reasons:

1. **Alignment with core language design**: R was specifically built for vectorized statistical operations.

2. **Performance optimization**: Vectorized operations in R typically execute significantly faster as they:
   - Utilize optimized C implementations
   - Minimize interpreter overhead
   - Leverage specialized numerical libraries
   - Reduce memory allocation and copying operations

3. **Code expressiveness**: Vectorized code concisely expresses intention, improving readability and maintainability.

4. **Error reduction**: Fewer lines of code means fewer opportunities for bugs.

5. **Mathematical coherence**: Vectorized operations better align with mathematical notation in statistical formulas.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Vector Operations

Prefer vectorized functions and operators over element-wise processing:

```r
# Non-vectorized (avoid)
result <- numeric(length(x))
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  result[i] <- sqrt(x[i]) + y[i]
}

# Vectorized (prefer)
result <- sqrt(x) + y
```

### Apply Functions

Use the apply family of functions (`lapply`, `sapply`, `vapply`, `mapply`, etc.) when vectorization of the entire operation is not possible:

```r
# Non-vectorized loop (avoid)
results <- vector("list", length(models))
for (i in seq_along(models)) {
  results[[i]] <- predict(models[[i]], newdata)
}

# Functional approach (prefer)
results <- lapply(models, predict, newdata = newdata)
```

### Vectorized Subsetting

Leverage R's vectorized subsetting operations:

```r
# Non-vectorized (avoid)
selected <- numeric(sum(condition))
j <- 1
for (i in seq_along(condition)) {
  if (condition[i]) {
    selected[j] <- data[i]
    j <- j + 1
  }
}

# Vectorized (prefer)
selected <- data[condition]
```

### Vectorized Functions

Prioritize vectorized functions in base R and key packages:

- `ifelse()` over conditional loops
- `rowSums()`, `colMeans()` over apply with sum/mean
- `outer()` for vectorized function application
- `%*%` for matrix operations
- `cut()` for binning continuous variables
- `findInterval()` for vectorized lookups

## Specialized Contexts

### Data Manipulation

In data.table or dplyr operations, utilize vectorized expressions:

```r
# data.table vectorized approach
dt[, new_col := log(col1) + col2 * col3]

# dplyr vectorized approach
df %>% mutate(new_col = log(col1) + col2 * col3)
```

### Statistical Modeling

Leverage R's vectorized formula notation:

```r
# Vectorized model formula
model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + I(x3^2), data = df)
```

## Exceptions and Limitations

Explicit iteration may still be necessary when:

1. **Stateful operations**: Operations depend on previous iterations
2. **Complex procedural logic**: Algorithm cannot be expressed vectorially
3. **Memory constraints**: Processing large chunks would exceed available memory
4. **Custom accumulation**: Need for specialized accumulation patterns

In these cases, consider:
- Pre-allocation of result structures
- Compiled solutions (Rcpp)
- Chunked processing approaches

## Performance Considerations

1. **Benchmark critical code**: Verify vectorization benefits with `microbenchmark` or `bench`
2. **Consider memory-computation tradeoffs**: Vectorization sometimes increases memory usage
3. **Be aware of implicit type conversions**: Ensure consistent data types in vectorized operations

## Example Implementations

### Matrix Operation

```r
# Slow approach with loops
result <- matrix(0, nrow(X), nrow(Y))
for (i in 1:nrow(X)) {
  for (j in 1:nrow(Y)) {
    result[i, j] <- sum(X[i, ] * Y[j, ])
  }
}

# Fast vectorized approach
result <- X %*% t(Y)
```

### Statistical Calculation

```r
# Non-vectorized z-score calculation
z_scores <- numeric(length(x))
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  z_scores[i] <- (x[i] - mean(x)) / sd(x)
}

# Vectorized z-score calculation
z_scores <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
```

## Integration with Other Principles

The Vectorization Principle complements and extends several other principles:

1. **MP0016 (Modularity)**: Vectorized operations promote functional cohesion
2. **MP0018 (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Vectorization reduces repetitive code patterns
3. **MP0023 (Language Preferences)**: Aligns with R's fundamental design philosophy
4. **MP0026 (R Statistical Query Language)**: Enables concise statistical expressions

## Historical Context

Vectorization has been fundamental to R since its inception, inherited from S and influenced by APL, a programming language specifically designed for array processing. This historical lineage explains why vectorization is not merely a performance optimization in R but a core design paradigm that shapes the entire language ecosystem.

## Rules Derived from This Principle

This meta-principle informs several specific rules:

1. **Apply Functions Over Loops**: Use lapply() family over explicit for loops
2. **Vectorized Predicates**: Use vectorized logical operations instead of element-wise comparisons
3. **Matrix Operations**: Use matrix algebra instead of element-wise calculations
4. **Vectorized String Operations**: Use vectorized string functions instead of character-by-character processing
