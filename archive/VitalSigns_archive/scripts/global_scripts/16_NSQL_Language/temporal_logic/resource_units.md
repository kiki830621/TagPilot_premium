# NSQL Resource Units

In addition to representing time units, phases and stages in NSQL also function as resource allocation units, providing a framework for managing computational resources.

## Phases and Stages as Resource Units

### Resource Dimensions

Phases and stages can be measured across multiple resource dimensions:

| Resource | Unit | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **CPU** | Cycles/% | Processor utilization |
| **Memory** | MB/GB | RAM allocation and usage |
| **GPU** | % Utilization | Graphics processing resources |
| **Network** | KB/MB | Data transfer volume |
| **Disk I/O** | Operations | Storage read/write operations |
| **Power** | Watts | Energy consumption |
| **Threads** | Count | Parallel execution units |

### Multi-Dimensional Resource Space

Each phase and stage occupies a position in multi-dimensional resource space:

```
           ┌─ Memory (MB)
           │
           │    ┌── UI Construction Stage
           │   ╱│
           │  ╱ │
           │ ╱  │
           │╱   │
           └────┼── CPU (%)
               ╱│
             ╱  │
           ╱    │
         ╱      │
        ╱       │
       └────────┘
          GPU (%)
```

## Resource Allocation Patterns

### Phase-Level Resource Allocation

Different phases have distinct resource profiles:

| Phase | CPU | Memory | GPU | Network | Characteristics |
|-------|-----|--------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| **Initialization** | High | Growing | Low-Med | Burst | CPU-intensive, memory accumulation |
| **Runtime** | Variable | Stable | Variable | Variable | Resource usage based on user interaction |
| **Termination** | Low | Decreasing | Low | Low | Resource release, minimal computation |

### Stage-Level Resource Allocation

Within the initialization phase, stages have specific resource profiles:

| Stage | CPU | Memory | GPU | Network | Characteristics |
|-------|-----|--------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| **System Init** | High | Low | Low | Low | CPU-bound library loading |
| **UI Construction** | Med | Med | High | Low | GPU for render tree creation |
| **Data Preparation** | High | High | Low | High | Memory for data, network for fetching |
| **Session Setup** | Low | Med | Low | Low | State establishment, minimal resource needs |

## Resource Budgeting

Just as with time budgets, applications can establish resource budgets for phases and stages:

```r
resource_budgets <- list(
  # Phase budgets
  initialization_phase = list(
    cpu_percent_max = 80,
    memory_mb_max = 500,
    gpu_percent_max = 30,
    network_mb_max = 50
  ),
  
  # Stage budgets
  ui_construction_stage = list(
    cpu_percent_max = 60,
    memory_mb_max = 200,
    gpu_percent_max = 30,
    network_mb_max = 5
  )
)
```

## Resource Monitoring

Resources can be monitored at phase and stage levels:

```r
# Monitor resources for a stage
monitor_stage_resources <- function(stage_name, stage_function) {
  # Start resource monitors
  start_cpu_monitor()
  start_memory_monitor()
  start_gpu_monitor()
  
  # Run the stage
  result <- stage_function()
  
  # Collect resource metrics
  cpu_usage <- get_cpu_usage()
  memory_usage <- get_memory_usage()
  gpu_usage <- get_gpu_usage()
  
  # Log resource usage
  log_resource_usage(stage_name, list(
    cpu = cpu_usage,
    memory = memory_usage,
    gpu = gpu_usage
  ))
  
  # Check against budgets
  check_resource_budget(stage_name, "cpu", cpu_usage)
  check_resource_budget(stage_name, "memory", memory_usage)
  check_resource_budget(stage_name, "gpu", gpu_usage)
  
  return(result)
}
```

## Resource Optimization Strategies

### Phase-Level Optimization

Optimize resource allocation at the phase level:

```r
# Limit resources at phase level
with_phase_resources <- function(phase_name, phase_function, resources) {
  # Set resource limits
  old_limits <- set_resource_limits(
    cpu_limit = resources$cpu,
    memory_limit = resources$memory,
    gpu_limit = resources$gpu
  )
  
  # Run the phase with limited resources
  tryCatch({
    result <- phase_function()
    return(result)
  }, finally = {
    # Restore original limits
    restore_resource_limits(old_limits)
  })
}

# Usage
initialization_result <- with_phase_resources(
  "initialization",
  initialization_phase,
  list(cpu = 0.8, memory = 500, gpu = 0.3)
)
```

### Stage-Level Optimization

Optimize resource allocation at the stage level:

```r
# Specialized resource allocation for UI Construction Stage
ui_construction_stage <- function() {
  # Allocate more GPU resources for UI rendering
  old_gpu_priority <- set_gpu_priority(high)
  
  tryCatch({
    # Create UI components with GPU acceleration
    create_accelerated_components()
  }, finally = {
    # Restore normal GPU priority
    set_gpu_priority(old_gpu_priority)
  })
}
```

## Resource-Time Tradeoffs

Phases and stages often involve tradeoffs between resource usage and execution time:

| Strategy | Time Impact | Resource Impact |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Parallel Execution** | Decreased | Increased CPU/Memory |
| **Lazy Loading** | Initial decrease, later increase | Decreased initial Memory |
| **GPU Acceleration** | Decreased | Increased GPU, decreased CPU |
| **Caching** | Decreased | Increased Memory |

## Resource Profiles for Common Operations

### UI-Related Operations

```r
# UI Component Creation Resource Profile
ui_component_resource_profile <- list(
  cpu = "medium",  # 30-50% single core
  memory = "low",  # 5-20MB per component
  gpu = "high",    # 20-40% utilization during render
  duration = "short"  # 10-100ms
)

# UI Event Handling Resource Profile
ui_event_resource_profile <- list(
  cpu = "high",    # 50-80% single core during event processing
  memory = "low",  # 1-10MB temporary allocation
  gpu = "low",     # 0-5% utilization
  duration = "very_short"  # 1-50ms
)
```

### Data-Related Operations

```r
# Data Loading Resource Profile
data_loading_resource_profile <- list(
  cpu = "medium",      # 20-40% utilization
  memory = "high",     # Depends on data size, can be 100MB+
  disk_io = "high",    # Many read operations
  network = "variable", # High if remote, zero if local
  duration = "long"     # 100ms-10s depending on size
)

# Data Transformation Resource Profile
data_transform_resource_profile <- list(
  cpu = "very_high",  # 80-100% utilization, often multi-core
  memory = "high",    # Often 2-3x data size temporarily
  gpu = "variable",   # High if using GPU acceleration
  duration = "medium" # 50ms-5s depending on complexity
)
```

## Resource-Aware Component Design

Design components to be aware of their resource needs:

```r
# Resource-aware component
resourceAwareComponent <- function(id, resource_profile) {
  # Register resource needs
  register_resource_requirements(id, resource_profile)
  
  # Create the component
  component <- function(input, output, session) {
    # Component implementation
    # ...
    
    # Monitor resource usage
    observe({
      current_usage <- get_component_resource_usage(id)
      if (exceeds_profile(current_usage, resource_profile)) {
        warning("Component exceeding resource profile: ", id)
      }
    })
  }
  
  return(component)
}

# Usage
dataTableComponent <- resourceAwareComponent(
  "data_table",
  list(
    cpu = "medium",
    memory = function(data_size) { return(data_size * 3) },
    render_time = function(rows) { return(0.01 * rows) }
  )
)
```
