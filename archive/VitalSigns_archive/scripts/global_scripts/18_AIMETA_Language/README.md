# AIMETA Language

## Overview

AIMETA (AI Meta-language) is a specialized meta-language designed for effective human-AI communication in technical contexts. It provides standardized patterns for expressing language types, processing directives, contextual information, and relationships between components.

## Purpose

The AIMETA language serves several key purposes:

1. **Standardizing Communication**: Creating consistent patterns for human-AI interaction
2. **Reducing Ambiguity**: Providing clear indicators about how information should be interpreted
3. **Enabling Meta-discussions**: Facilitating discussions about language and processing
4. **Promoting Consistency**: Ensuring systematic approaches to similar problems
5. **Efficient Knowledge Transfer**: Communicating patterns and relationships concisely

## Core Components

### 1. Language Type Indicators
Methods for explicitly identifying which formal language a statement uses.

### 2. Processing Directives
Instructions for how content should be transformed or processed.

### 3. Contextual Qualifiers
Additional information about domain, purpose, or constraints.

### 4. Analogy Notation
Expressing structural and behavioral similarities between components.

## Formal Definition

AIMETA is formally defined in MP25 (AI Communication Meta-Language) with specific notations and conventions outlined in this directory.

## Documentation

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| AIMETA_01_analogy_notation.md | Defines the analogy notation (~) for expressing similarities |

## Usage Examples

### Language Type Indication

```
Calculate the RFM of each customer (NSQL)
```

### Processing Directive

```
NSQL:
show sales by region
TO SQL
```

### Contextual Qualifier

```
Show top customers by revenue (CONSTRAINTS: last_quarter, north_america_only)
```

### Analogy Notation

```
app_config.yaml->navbar ~ app_config.yaml->sidebar
```

## Benefits of AIMETA

1. **Clarity**: Reduces ambiguity in requirements and implementation instructions
2. **Efficiency**: Enables concise communication of complex patterns
3. **Consistency**: Promotes uniform approaches across the system
4. **Learnability**: Provides a structured way to express meta-information
5. **Integration**: Works well with other formal languages in the system

## Relationship to Other Components

AIMETA complements other formal languages in the system:
- **NSQL**: AIMETA can be used to indicate NSQL statements and transformations
- **RSQL**: AIMETA can provide context for RSQL queries
- **Configuration**: AIMETA can express relationships between configuration elements

## Future Extensions

The AIMETA language is designed to be extensible. Future additions may include:
- Implementation directives
- Validation patterns
- Performance requirements notation
- User interaction patterns
