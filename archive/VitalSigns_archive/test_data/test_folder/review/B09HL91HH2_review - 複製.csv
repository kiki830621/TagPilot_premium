"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2023","Reviewer Dr. Beth","yes","yes","Great modern jewelry box with a lot of versatility","For years, I used a fairly old-fashioned wooden jewelry box. I was ready to modernized, but had a hard time finding something to meet my needs. I wanted to be able to still hang my necklaces to avoid tangling, and I also wanted drawers with compartments to keep my earrings and bracelets separate. Finally, I decided that the best solution would be to order THREE of these jewelry boxes - one in this smaller size (single drawer) and two in a larger size (with two drawers each).The jewelry boxes look just as pictured and are well constructed. I really like that some of the dividers can be removed, so you can adjust the sections of of the drawers. The space to hang necklaces in the lids works pretty well, although it could be a little better. You definitely need to tuck both ends of each necklace into the pocket so that they don't hang and prevent the lid from closing; it would have been helpful if there had been an elastic that ran across the center, but it still works pretty well. These jewelry boxes are quite roomy - the main reason I purchased three is because I wanted more drawers. I would have loved a single box that had the same top but about six total drawers! Still, this has been a very good solution for me, and overall I would rate these boxes 4 1/2 stars.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30TX1TEB1EJTK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09HL91HH2","B09HL8T89T","Color: Champagne"

They did NOT ask me to revise my review, but I am choosing to do so because I can highly recommend the seller, even if the jewelry box didn’t meet my expectations.This jewelry box holds a lot, but not all of my jewelry. There’s no place for chunky necklaces and the necklace holders barely work for dainty chains. Opening and closing the lid causes them to come out of the little pouch below the hooks. In the earring section, the holes face the wrong way, so if you use them, the earrings won’t face up so you can see them. Overall, it’s fine, but I had to order a second box with a different design to hold my chunky jewelry.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pEpK8q2EL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4AHQDJNDFXD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09HL91HH2","B09HL8T89T","Color: Champagne"
