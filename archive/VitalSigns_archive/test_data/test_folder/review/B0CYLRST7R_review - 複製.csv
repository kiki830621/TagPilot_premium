I‚Äôve been storing my thousands of earrings and bracelets in their original boxes for the past 5 years, and am so sick of losing things or forgetting what I have. I always think back to when I was a little girl and liked looking though my Mom‚Äôs wooden jewelry box, and how organized it looked. So glad I found this one!!It‚Äôs made really well and even smelled like wood when I took it out of the box. Came packaged nicely so it was protected during shipping. There‚Äôs plenty of space for all of my things! Love the bottom drawer.I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with it!

The three-layer design makes it super easy to keep everything organized, and the removable dividers give me flexibility to store different types of jewelry.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024","MissyinDC","yes","yes","Beautiful wood, solid construction","I am very happy with this jewelry box. It was everything I was looking for. Classic, with a mid-century look, and built to last. It was packaged carefully and is made with solid wood with a spacious linen-lined interior. The drawer moves smoothly and the glass top is great for easily and quickly seeing what I need. The only change I would request is for a soft close top, but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm clumsy and sometimes forgetful and could see the top slamming shut unexpectedly and the glass possibly breaking. Though the glass appears to be thick and sturdy. That said, this is otherwise perfect and a good value for a solid wooden piece.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Lion","-","yes","Even nicer in person than in the product photos","My expectations were low as I had just done a review for a jewelry box more expensive than this one that was made poorly. Much to my surprise, this gorgeous real wood jewelry box showed up at my doorstep. It‚Äôs the perfect size for all of my earrings, bracelets, watches, and broaches. The one limitation is there‚Äôs no hanging space for necklaces, but this box is gorgeous enough that even if you need another little rack for necklaces it could still be worth it for you.The drawers sit flush and open smoothly, the lid stays up when opened, the glass top is high quality, I honestly can‚Äôt find any drawbacks.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Hallmen House","-","yes","Beautiful And Timeless","Pros: I really enjoy the simplicity of the design and the beauty of the craftsmanship. The wood is solid and put together very nicely. All of the surfaces and edges are smooth and the corners and drawers are seamlessly joined. The hinges work well and have no resistance or sound when being used. The dividers are strong and not flimsy pieces of cardboard. The pillow rolls for holding rings are sturdy but soft and have a good hold so nothing will fall out.The glass top offers a nice peek into the contents and grabs my attention, which I enjoy because I have been wearing and switching out my pieces more often. The style is great because it can match a farmhouse aesthetic or a modern aesthetic, great for teens or adults and would make a great gift.  The jewelry box came with 4 little rubber ‚Äòdot‚Äô feet already attached on the bottom to prevent it from slipping and to keep the wood in good condition. The light linen fabric inside adds a nice modern touch and offers protection to the jewelry so they don‚Äôt get scratched or tangled as easily. This box feels like an heirloom style piece that could have been handed down to me, and will see be beautiful when I hand it down to the next person. I really like this jewelry box.Cons: When first opening the package the smell was quite strong. I believe it‚Äôs the adhesive used to hold the linen fabric and dividers into place. The smell did go away after 48 hours though.I really enjoy this jewelry box.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61x+qD3s2VL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SSENB7DE6MP3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYLRST7R","B0CYLSTT3C","Style: 3 Layer"

So many are particle board with a plastic wood grain veneer, or poorly made. Not this one. It's real wood with a glass lid and well constructed. I like the simple design.

Fortunately, it looks even better than the photos depict. The quality of every aspect is perfect! The wood is finished to a tee. It reminds me of the retro 60‚Äôs look or Shaker style with the sleek design and smooth appearance. I appreciate that the drawer comes out completely as sometimes items fall behind them. The hinges on the lid are solid and work well. I even love the linen material which will help keep dirt from sticking like felt does.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2024","Heather H.","-","-","Great for Convenient Access to Frequently Worn Items, High Quality Wooden Box","This is a lovely looking and functional jewelry storage box. The solid wood construction is both sturdy and durable. The hinges keep the glass lid firmly affixed and the lid opens and closes with ease. The drawer underneath the main compartment slides in and out smoothly. As far as the interior is concerned it is well designed. The compartments are of good usable sizes that can accommodate a variety of different types of jewelry. The linen lining is consistent throughout and without raw or rough edges. I do not feel that it is accurate to call the linen lining soft, as a matter of fact it is rather course. This being said, it is not scratchy to the point where it would damage jewelry. Personally I greatly prefer a velvet lining, but this lining is perfectly fine. The box really does stand out for being a functional storage piece. It doesn't take up too much room, holds a lot, looks nice, and is well made. It is well suited to my needs too. I ordered this as extra jewelry box. My very large stand up jewelry box holds the majority of my jewelry, but the stuff that I wear on a frequent basis has now found a home in this new box. It affords convenient access. Great buy.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9EAP2X4MWNC2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYLRST7R","B0CYLRST7R","Style: 2 Layer"
