It's either super awesome or so bad you want to know about it in order for me to write a review.Having said that, this is a 5-star purchase.  My overall expectations were pretty low as I was convinced this box was not going to do the job for me.However.I moved in to it and this is what's in my box right now:13 necklaces7 bracelets3 anklets1 watch26 rings54 pair of earrings9 charms/pendants/pinsYou should know there is a tiny room left for another ring or two, but basically this box is packed full but not in such a way that I'm having to dig through it for stuff, I can still easily get to what I need even though a couple of cubbies have more than one item in them.  I'm an OCD neat freak and must have easy access to things and they have to be organized. This box actually makes me happy just knowing everything is in one organized place (before I had earrings in a nightstand drawer, rings and necklaces in the safe, my watch and a couple bracelets were in my desk drawer, etc).There is one con and I need to mention it. The box is off-gassing and fumey probably from the glues.  I've been letting it air for the last few days and either I'm really used to the smell or it's actually much better than it was. I'm not concerned that this will be on-going, it's like new carpet, eventually it airs out.Two thumbs up and 5-star rating from a 51 year old broad in California. Cheers.I only gave this a 3star for giftable, and that's my opinion for what it's worth. I think a jewelry box is a very personal thing and I would never choose one for someone else.As for the locking mechanism, lots of folks said they wish you could lock the whole box, but really, if someone comes in your house, they're going to pick the whole thing up and walk out with it. The top compartment that locks is sufficient for prying fingers at home.",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Dc4FbXiML.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mrCQccUwL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J5nIiH-0L.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWCI47BPNXBJD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLCH13T7","-","-"
"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020","Alexis","yes","yes","Beautiful but not “perfect”","Five stars because it was meant for me.Some things you may want to be aware of though..This jewelry box is not in any way brand new. Maybe not ever purchased but this is not a new product. It has that smell of being from a garage sale or left in a basement. The interior is discolored and it almost made me rethink using it. Then I was like, this thing is beautiful. With the white leather look to the amount it holds. I feel if you have a massive collection, this may not be for you. It holds a lot but my collection is small in comparison to others. I decided it’s five stars because it’s meant for me, and I love it. I believe in that sort of thing. This beautiful jewelry box, unloved - not purchased. Finally has a home, haha.If you want sleek, shiny and brand new - this isn’t for you. If you want something beautiful on the outside and not perfect on the inside, hands down recommend. Do a good palo santo cleanse on it and you’re good to go. Perfect for me. I do not think it should be priced as high - that should be changed.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CVRXLVNT2I23/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLCH13T7","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020","Amy Chung","yes","yes","It’s okay but I have some complaints","It was super good but the only problem was that it the inside felt cheap. So it’s very nice on the outside, the leather feels like leather but the insides are pretty much thin cardboard wrapped with a velvet type cover. To open the drawers the leather would sometimes stick to one another making it hard to open. And just the box itself is pretty heavy. And lastly the earring stud holders were hard to put back into its slots after taking them out to put earrings in. P.S the package came and it was very warm making the velvet feel weird so I’d let it sit out and cool down then touch it. It wasn’t worth the huge price tag but it still useable and pretty large.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24V5I95XA7DMG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLCH13T7","-","-"

It's pretty hefty, but I do feel that it was overpriced for not even being real leather and having the mirror glued a bit sloppily. The drawers are large enough to hold a good deal of jewelry, but they do not slide very cleanly and I have to maneuver them a bit to get them to fit back in their slots evenly. It also did not come with a key to lock the top portion, which was the whole reason why I bought this jewelry box in the first place.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2021","Star","yes","yes","Lock is useless, but it’s way bigger than my old one and seems better quality (TLDR at bottom)","I’ve had my original jewelry box since early 2015 and I’ve accumulated so much over the years it was so disorganized and overflowing. It wasn’t big enough to hang necklaces, so I used the sides to hang earrings and when I got this new one, had to get the enormous tangles out of all my chains. I wish I had a before picture from before I moved the jewelry to the new one; it was a mess. The first two photos are the old one.The new one is much bigger, and I’m able to hang my chains and necklaces. I read some reviews before I got it that you have to stuff the pendants in the bottom pockets and they tangle there, but I got around that by hanging them differently so they barely meet the little pocket at the bottom. Some of the areas are a little small; there were still some spots that I dedicated to chokers and these multicolored necklaces that are overflowing in the third drawer, but will probably tangle if I moved them to the big one, but I was able to fit my really long earrings there so that was nice. The little spots in the second drawer are amazing! i have so many pendants with no dedicated chains, so I switch them out a lot, and I had little areas where I could put them all, and where I could put my dangly earrings since there wasn’t a dedicated spot in the earring drawer (first drawer). I do love the earring drawer though, I can also put rings in it if I want. The dividers seem useless in the sense that I probably won’t put anything between them, since when you have to pull them out to take the earrings out anything there would all fall to the bottom. Under the bottom one is fine for small backings. If anyone knows a better way to use the earring drawer I’d love to know (for the dangly ones). I don’t wear watches but the top was great for all my bracelets once I took the watch pillows out; I kept one to use for the beaded stretchy bracelets just because it looks nice. I don’t have a lot of rings, so the top fit all mine, but I want more so I’ll probably have to move some to the earring drawer once I get more.The only thing I prefer about my old one (besides it came with a travel case you could take in and out, but I hardly used it, and it got stolen anyway) is that the lock actually mattered. All the sides closed around the drawers and buttons, then locked in place with the top, so you couldn’t get in without the key at all. This new one; the lock only locks the top. You can get to all the drawers and sides for necklaces without the key. This isn’t a huge deal for me, since I rarely locked my old box anyway, and it’s not like I have expensive jewelry. But it would be nice for if I was going out of town.TLDR,The lock only locks the top, so anything really valuable you’d have to put in there. The sides are great for keeping necklaces and chains untangled. In short, it’s a great box of you need space and love meticulous organization.",4,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B10+hZSEJaS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B11Nz4w58XS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B15X3MTaueS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B19k9JlZVkS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1B6FyNx7JS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1RjnLgEsHS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YI3maWl0S.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YZOgKwrFS.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1sH-yucF4S.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1zN2Rh7H2S.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QIYLH98D7STV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLCH13T7","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2019","tallgal","yes","yes","Storage Galore.","This is a nice design. This has partitions, (organizers), that can be removed, so you can  customize things the way that you want. There is a place to put different kinds of jewelry, earrings, rings, necklaces, etc. The one drawback, is that even though there is a place to hang necklaces, there is an attached cloth bag, at the bottom.  Although  this was probably done to protect pendents, on the bottom of the necklaces, it could actually lead to tangling, since it causes the necklaces to group too closely together. This defeats the purpose, that I was going for, in trying to find  something I could hang my necklaces in, (instead of storing them flat ),to try and keep them free of tangles. I wish that feature had been left off, and that the necklaces could hang freely, away from each other. I do like the overall design, and storage, however, so decided to keep it.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRFSRU8L3D89F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLCH13T7","-","-"

I was surprised that I was able to fit all my jewelry, not only in the ring and earring slotted drawers, but also able to store some items that I keep in boxes in the bottom drawer. The top part that has little pillows for bracelets or watches is a nice feature. I was even able to put my husbands watches in them.  He says it looks like a mini jewelry store display.I had a standing jewelry cabinet before this. I like this better as it doesn't take up floor space and I can move it around or even keep it in my closet.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D4CN6TUNNBA3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLCH13T7","-","-"

Has plenty of storage space. The top compartment comes with a key if you have expensive jewelry. Each side has 8 hooks for necklaces. The rings space is kind of limited but plenty of space for earrings. The bottom drawer is the deeper one where you can keep sunglasses or hair claws.

All of the hardware feels sturdy and it doesn’t feel cheap. My also does not have a smell. I saw some reviews about a smell but mine does not. The only thing I would change about this is that the drawers didn’t pull all the way out.
